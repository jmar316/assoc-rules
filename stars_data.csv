Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest.

Be prepared to eat.  

I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts.   Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.

It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.

You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone.",review,5,Au3Qs-AAZEWu2_4gIMwRgw

prices are right on, baked goods are pretty great.  service is fast and friendly - really fast.  i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal.  i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is.  sure it's a ""greasy spoon"" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  can't recommend this place enough for great breakfasts.",review,4,MPKMK36Xp0GuaWaXlUwZ8Q

wife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns. hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh.

I was pleasantly surprised.  We actually had to cancel our first appointment because we were having some major electrical work done that morning and the power was shut off at the time the appointment was supposed to be.  THEY actually called us a little later in the afternoon to find out how things were going and asked when they could send someone out.  They came out on time and got right to work.  The technician was nice and knowledgeable and explained to me that our A/C was shot (bad compressor and burned out wires- we were worried this might be the case after he said it was almost 20 years old).  I was glad to hear he knew about the warranty process and explained how that would all work too.

It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no problem getting a table.  The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.

Green Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!

I had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  We are DEFINITELY coming back!

The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)

Hint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.
hint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!

I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?

To begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  

Do not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.

The AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).

So give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.",review,4,idQx85xfiIm_SGTnDsaXcQ

Our host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  

The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  

For the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. 

Craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.

The highlights:
- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. 
- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.
- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. 
- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. 

If you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.",review,0,ECOZNokNazcdgocyCRJw6g

It had an attached, good sized bathroom which was great, and my daughter loved that she got to take a bath in a tub that was over 100 years old.  (The water pressure is great by the way).  There was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  The room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  Craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  He was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.

We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madison-area B&B's.  Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.

Has wifi. Has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog. Street parking. Does not have private bathrooms for each room, so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to you.

Craig the owner and Coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party. Craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if I needed something, etc. I called him later that night after I realized I had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. It felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. 
Our group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so Craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. One morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (?), a local specialty.

- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top
- the sauce is sweet and savory
- the cheese is rich and delicious
- the veggies were fresh and tasty

We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.

We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.

The service was casual and friendly.

In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.

Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. 

I gave it a shot and I was impressed! 

First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. 

The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. 

The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. 

Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. 

The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. 

Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.

The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.

A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat.

I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. 

I have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time.

Back to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  

My husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.

I explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a ""closer"" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.

Fortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.

Did I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.

233,rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA,1,2013-06-04,0,qjvo8SZMWwEkjkB4UBs5gw,5,"I can't say enough great things about this location in Middleton.  Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.

I'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these ""favors"" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  

As I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a ""home away from home"".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  

The manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  

There are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.

Unfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. 

I noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.

I also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  

There is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food ""to-go""  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.

Jan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  

My final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.

I had the special salad of the day. It was delicious, a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery, and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese I've had in a very long time. My lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious.

I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot. Anyone who likes The Walking Dead AND Downton Abbey is alright in my book!

All Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days. They communicate clearly about diagnostic and treatment options. Their prices are very reasonable, and they try less expensive solutions first, instead of immediately recommending the most costly. Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up. When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.

That's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff. Maybe it's my fiction-writer's imagination, but they really make me feel like a VIP. Kenna is always so excited to greet my pups and I love hearing about hers. Dana has a killer sense of humor and if you're lucky, she'll grace you with one of her zingers.

The place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.

The food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.

Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.

Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka ""Maria's special"". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  

Service is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told ""yeah, if you can find seats"".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night.

When my son was receiving treatments for spine/ brain cancer, at UW Hospital, we did not  have many choices at that time of where to stay during and between treatments.

Altho we had spent time at the Ronald McDoanld house, after a time I needed to make my son feel less a patient and more like a celebrity for a day. So I decided to take a paycheck, and chose a day between visits to get a suite at the Marriott West. 
Altho my son had to use a mobile IV unit, and was scarred on his  head from radiation burns, this Marriott was most accomodating and incredible.
We had a gorgeous suite, exquistie room service and gracious attentions.

I'm convinced that Dick & Arnie's is one of Madison's/Middleton's best kept secrets.  True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.

That said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  

The place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.

Set aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is ""cushion"" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.

This review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  

When you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful ""contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained"" feeling afterwards.  

A quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The ""Philly"" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.

The best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here.",review,2,aiNWxSrNrRI3cgwbH4vw0A

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 

The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar.

PRODUCT: 
First, their product selection is second to none. They have styles for anyone's taste - fun, practical, trendy, high fashion, you name it.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The optician that assisted me, Ben, has a natural talent for consultative sales. There was absolutely zero pressure involved and he helped me identify two products that genuinely fit my personality, appearance, and lifestyle. I was grateful that he was honest and as a result of his expertise I left with two pairs of eyewear that I can't wear enough.

I have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. 

I have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. 

I have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!

I have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.

The only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.",review,0,Hh5zSZtaO7mNy5N-ZhEvsw

This is a great casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local couple.  She can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen.  Their passion is reflected in the quality of their food and the high level of service provided to their guests.

Their food is some of the best in the area - they focus on Northern Italian cusine.  It's simple, fresh, and delicious!  They always offer a variety of specials.  

The portions are huge!  You definitely feel like you are getting your money's worth.  I have never left without leftovers.

Small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner Clarissa greets us like family when we walk in. Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).

 There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  

We are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. Get one if you have someone to share it with.

No visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  

Picnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. 

A large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.

The staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.

During the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.

The gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.

So... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

We visited Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with Zimbrick VW in Middleton. Otto was very helpful. He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.

Zimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day. He even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car!

Tim Regan was my Sales & Leasing Consultant; he asked me about my driving habits and needs and then gave me suggestions on what the best car to fit me would be.  During the test drive, Tim was friendly, personable and gave me information about the car, the company and himself personally. 

I decided to purchase a 2014 Jetta. Tim knew I was in the middle of hellish week as busy season was wrapping up at work.  He was patient with my lack of free time and worked around my schedule to get paperwork signed.  I took the car home that night.  The next day, Tim, came to my work place (bringing me my favorite Starbucks drink!) to pick up the car and take it back to the dealership for cleaning and detailing.

When Tim brought back my shiny, clean car, he spent a hour with me, walking me through all the features, explaining the little details and answering all my questions.  I was so comfortable with him and even happier with my purchase.

We got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog.

Veggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5"" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich.

Grilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!

Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess.

The complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite. And the meal only got better. But the biggest surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed. The cook came crashing out of the kitchen, carrying a CPR mask in one hand and a bloody meat cleaver in the other. Through his quick action, the cook was able to resucitate the homeless man. As we all applauded, the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand. The homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great big bear hug.

I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. 
One advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. 
The parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there.

I called Triple A and they dispatched Prarie Land Towing. Shawn, the driver, tried to jump start the vehicle.  When that failed, he hooked us up and towed us in. Meanwhile, he called ahead to have someone at the shop prep a loaner car for us to use locally until the shop opened in the morning.

We called around 8 AM, but they didn't have a report yet, so we called to have a rental car ready. We asked about whether they were open on Sundays, because that was when we would be coming back through. Although not normally open on Sunday, they were willing to make arrangements with us so we could pick up the car.

At 10:15 AM, they called to let us know whe could pick up the car in 15 minutes. We cancelled the rental and were on the road by 11 AM. Because of the folks at Prairie Land Towing, we made it to our conference, arriving only a few hours later than we planned, but without missing any major events.

I scouted a few locations, with a few places never getting back to me.  We've a large amount of family and friends for this traditional celebration so I needed a place that was both Big (enough for 300+ guests), Bold (that WOW factor when they even entered the building, foyer and ballroom) and Beautiful (for a place that would accentuate my daughter and her Epic Ballgown.)

I sent an email to Lake Windsor with no response.  Two weeks later I called, turns out my email was never received. See?  It pays to follow-up!  My contact from then on was with Ms. Jennifer Larson, the general manager to Lake Windsor Golf and Country Club.  

I need you to understand that this traditional event was very important.  I have been thinking about my daughters 'Coming of Age' party since she was five (5) and I went into the planning stages of this event early in 2009.  Jennifer and I spoke by phone and we met up the following afternoon. She was very informative, knowledgeable, and welcoming. No one had had such an event there at Windsor so she was very excited about this one!  We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!

My daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.

If you'd like to see how great it turned out and how beautiful Windsor (and my daughter) really is, we've got the video here: http://youtu.be/DCX7KZQCzcE?t=2m8s

Gritty details:
36 hours before I was due to close on my Madison home, the title company called me to ""remind"" me that I needed to have a cashier's check at closing to cover the downpayment and closing costs. That was the first I had heard of needing a cashier's check... when I bought my house in AR, I just wrote a check and things were good.

Apparently this title company doesn't accept personal checks, which put me in a bind, because my primary bank account is still with a bank in Arkansas. There was absolutely no way I could get a cashier's check from them in less than 36 hours. Eeek!

I have a savings account, a Visa credit card, and an auto loan with this Summit location, so I visited them to ask for ideas/help. They suggested using my debit card (from AR) to do a cash advance into my Summit savings account, at which point they could generate a cashier's check for me.

I called my AR bank and asked them to raise the daily debit limit; they did it immediately. Summit then ran the cash advance, and presto-changeo, things were golden. Total cost? zero-point-zero! So cool.

I've had nothing but great experiences here, and today continued that streak. I was truly stressed, because I stood to lose my earnest money deposit if the closing would've failed. Shaun and Summit saved the day for me. Thanks!",review,2,oFhtzLhXS1iENWoBMdWk4w

I went there because the Isthmus Annual Manual said it had great wood-oven pizzas.  I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' ""supreme"") and tap water.

This was an extraordinary pizza.  The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS).

The truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created

It's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good.  A  billowing perfect crust - -  superb textures all around - -  ingredients with satisfying flavor - -  a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it).  Nice serrvice.

First of all, the new pricing policy is great. Three tiers: 1) standard price, 2) month-long specials, 3)markdowns straight to ""best price"" - so if you see something with the red tag you know that it's the lowest it'll be. And, wow, they are going low. 

I got my little cousin 5 shirts, 1 skort, and a pair of jeans for $17 2 weeks ago for her birthday. Yes, kids clothes are cheaper than adult clothes in general, but this was just a steal.  Last night I found a pair of M-N-G (Mango) jeans for $5. FIVE DOLLARS! And they're doing a total remodel of the store and have already installed a really fashion-forward jeans department featuring Levi's products (which, sadly, have never worked for me - but it's still a well designed department) and a really wonderful, if a bit small, shoe department.

Fashion-wise, having lived in Europe for 3 years I can say with confidence that the M-N-G line that Mango is doing for Penney's is sometimes even better than the stuff in their standard stores in the UK and Europe (I kept noticing this on trips to the US). They've also got other designer collaborations and seem to be trying to compete with the fashion-forward nature of Target, etc. while keeping hold on the more traditional department store branding as well.

Since moving back to the US in the Spring, I've been shopping more at Penney's that I had in probably the 5 years before I left. This location and the West Towne location are really making great strides.",review,0,oSA746-4MCJpWorJkzxqpQ

When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.

I really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  

I've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.

I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter NOTO. What an awesome little find!

After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!

First, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.

On to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.

The name ""take-out"" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.

I admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity. We ordered two dishes for three people. We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people. Large portions, cheap prices. 

Then we tasted it. We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good -- the flavors were great, the stuff was actually spicy, and I found I could love jambalaya (normally not a fan).  We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter. 

While the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints. You can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture, rather than giving you a week's worth of food. That works for me -- we were all full off our dishes and very happy.",review,0,fzvX93h2jQtnp5g7I0Ehaw

You can order in advanced (at least one hour ahead of time), or you can ask for a cab to be sent as soon as one is available. The online system also allows you to track your cab (once it has been assigned to you) and gives you an estimated time of arrival (fabulous!). 

Side note: I noticed that calling the number they have listed on their website is a huge pain in the ass and the hold time is always longer than their estimate. As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. 

When the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).

Also, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set. There is no need to pull out your wallet and risk leaving it in the cab or dropping it on the street!

Thumbs up, Union Cab! I'm in love with all this technology!!

 Another time, there was a bit of a wait (they were insanely busy just before a holiday weekend, but still smiling and keeping it cool, even though I could see the exhaustion in their eyes) because they were backed up on getting their cars cleaned on the inside before they could ok them for rent.
 I told them I didn't really care, had no one to impress, and they could give me a dirty car as long as there wasn't literally bodily fluids inside it. Save yourselves a few minutes on cleaning that, I'm probably going to put new trash and crumbs in it shortly anyway. 

They looked at me, and told me that they appreciated my sentiment and apologize for the wait, but they would feel bad about giving me a crumby car. So, tell you what. Lets just bump you up the list of cars and give you a free upgrade to a higher class of car, of which we already have one cleaned and ready.  I said that wasn't necessary, I wasn't in a rush.  They said they wanted me to have it, because I was so nice and a good customer besides. Well. I guess if you insist on a free upgrade... I'll take it. 

I like that the corporate Enterprise seems to value this sort of behavior in it's employees, and fosters a positive work environment.

This kid in my school, his name was Weston, came up behind me and, without warning, kicked me in the crotch as hard as he could.  It was the kind of kick where I didn't see it coming.  His foot caught me right in the jewel-box and lifted me a good six inches off the ground.  I felt everything go weak in my body.  I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming.  I cried like a little baby.  You would have, too.  

Weston ran off--I didn't find out he was the one who did it until days later.  When the playground teacher walked over to find out what was wrong with me, I couldn't even talk to tell her what had happened.  I thew up from the pain.  

When I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered a few feet out in front of me and landed in a puddle.  It was ruined.  And I had brought that book from home.

For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again.

But he made me do some research first. And he asked me what I'd be using the bike for. Earl and I talked for about an hour that day, and I left the shop with a few of Earl's suggestions: bikes and companies I had never heard of or considered (Handsome Cycles, Soma, All-City, to name a few). 

I still wanted that Surly, though, so I went back. ""Build me a Surly!"" Earl said he would. But I'm short (barely five-foot-two), so Earl wanted to make sure I'd actually fit on a Surly before ordering one. He called a previous customer and asked her to bring in her Surly. He hooked the bike up to the trainer, watched me pedal, told me to shift, told me to break, told me to actually ride the bike, and I did. So, he ordered me the surly. 

The whole process - sitting down, ordering the bike (the Cross-Check), picking the color (wonderful lime green), selecting the seat and pedals and fenders and, and, and - took about twenty minutes. The building of the bike took exactly a week. And it's a beautiful bike. Sleek and clean and fast and light. Put together expertly. Adjusted at least three times (Can you raise the seat? Can you lower the seat? Can you pull the handlebars forward? Can you pull the seat forward?) the day I picked it up. Happily. 

It was a dream, building this bike with Revolution. Not once did I feel pressured by Earl or the rest of the crew at Revolution. Not once did I feel belittled, talked down to, or laughed at. Not once did I feel that my dream bike wasn't cool enough, worthy enough, or good enough to build. I had a bike in mind, and Earl told me to think about it. I thought about it, and Earl told me they could do it. And they did. Professionally, quickly, expertly. And I could not be happier with the bike I've got now. 

I'll come back again and again and again to these guys because they're just that good. For everything. Fixing up old bikes, like my Specialized, and building new ones. The best.",review,3,Y_u9tbGWwEAIZs5ja8ZAzA

They have always been friendly and helpful when I have a need for my bike. However, those reviews seem to be from older dates (most of them..), so perhaps there's a management change and please give revolution a chance!!

The bike shop is a middle-sized shop, so they might not have as much variety of products as other huge bike shops. The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.

I trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready. It fits well, the gears are surprisingly smooth for a no gear gal like me. Everything was great!

For those of you that take the good time to read my mediocre reviews, you'll know that I recently bought a fat bike. And I love it. Really, really love it.

But, I don't particularly enjoy the amount of water and crud those huge tires sling around. After my last ride, it felt like I was carrying around an extra 10-lbs of salty water weight, primarily in my bike shorts. Memories of a dirty diaper came to mind... 

So, I set about looking for fenders. I visited several bike stores in the area, none had what I was looking for in stock. So, I went online and ordered a set from Amazon. Who, eventually e-mailed me a ""whoops, sorry, those aren't in stock after all"" message. Curses!

Then I remembered that Revolution was just around the corner from my house, so I quick raced over to see if they had a set of fenders. And they did! Win!!

But... they were installed on a bike that was on the show floor. Fail!!

I inquired if they had extra fenders in stock - nope. 

I inquired if they would be interested in selling the ones from the show floor bike - yep!

Win again!!

And, because the fenders had been ""used"" (for one ride), they gave me an unnecessary, but greatly appreciated discount. 

Talk about nice guys. Thank you!!

However, my friend was in town, and I thought, ""why the heck not? live a little!"" so I brought her here.

On our way to McDonald's, also known as ""Mickey D's"" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance.

However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!! 

We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.  

As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. 

I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken ""McNugget"" Pieces.

When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer. 
 
As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. 

Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  

As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.

I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!

Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo. 

Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone.

The chunks of clam were huge and tender, not chewy.  The soup wasn't too thick that it overshadowed the clams, onions and potatoes.  We both ordered the deep fried cod.  One of the best we've had.  It came out hot and crispy.  The batter wasn't too oily and you could taste the flakey cod.  The waitress was very busy but always available if we needed anything.  I can't wait to eat there more.

Seriously, this place is a dive bar, not a high-end french restaurant.  The servers sometimes double as bartenders.  You do not go to this place for the fast service, that is what people made McDonald's for.  You go for the 1lb. burgers!  They range from $7-$8.  How do they make money?

Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast.  The server was friendly and precise (I did not want onions, I did not get onions).  That care barely be said about high end restaurants.  It was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came.  They are huge.  I had a cheeseburger.  I barely made it through half.  They are cooked medium well, but they are still so juicy.  The vegetables are fresh and generous.  I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger.  

My friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  I could barely see the burger under the bacon.  It was amazing.  I dared not try that on my first time out.

This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time. Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food.

(believe me, i know--i lived in florida with nowhere to shop but publix.)  upon settling in the jenny spaight area, the search for groceries began.
 i have two rules:  i want to shop in my neighborhood--preferably locally owned, and i want to be able to do 90% of my food/beer buying in one place.  now certainly, being the good isthmus dweller that i am, i cherish the co-op.  problem is, i have a serious diet coke addiction, as well as a lust for some other salty, fat-laden goodies, which means that the co-op doesn't satisfy rule number 2.  
then, i discover jenny street market.  it is love at first sight.  a small, locally owned grocery store full of friendly faces and nifty food finds.  what more could i want?  decent array of produce? check. fine selection of cheeses?  it's wisconsin.  fage yogurts?  um-huh.  more ice cream than you can shake a stick at?  got it.  fancy crackers (i am a sucker)?  yep.  a walk-in beer cooler, complete with jackets for comfort? oh yeah.  nonni's biscotti?  yes ma'am.  and of course, diet cokes.
i love the neighborhood grocery.  makes me feel at home.  prices are a bit higher (so i hear) than woodmans (never been) or some of the other bigger stores, but i feel good supporting local markets.  selection may not be as vast as the biggies, but the bottom line is if i can't find it at jenny's, i don't need it.",review,2,oRi4cSfHDjrpdZdaYZ6nJg

This is my favorite place to shop in Madison, and I've tried them all, many times.

Fresh-squeezed orange juice? Check. Decently priced bread? Check. Good produce? Check. Knowledgeable butcher? Check. Great wine selection & prices? Check. Not the Co-op? Check.

The problem with Woodman's is it sucks the life force out of you and makes you want to stick your head in a toilet, though goods are so cheap that you return again and suffer again and so on. The problem with the Co-op is . . . well, it's The Co-Op. Good for some things, important for ethically raised, locally sourced meat, but but but but but. 

Jenifer St. Market is a great local joint that really is a midway type of place. It's easy to get around in, which is probably its greatest strength. You can't find everything here, but you can find most things. I often find too much candy, but that's my own idiosyncratic problem. The wine selection is pretty good and the prices are really reasonable! I got two bottles last night, one white and one red, and didn't pay more than $12 for either. The meat counter is superb, though the ethical meat selection isn't so hot (they do sell Bare rotisserie chickens and Bell and Evans whole and pieced chickens, same as the Co-Op). 

Some downsides:

-Extremely annoying cash-only policy. There's a free ATM out front (you get charged $1 and then the machine gives you a $1 coupon). 

 -The market seems to have a policy of only hiring 16-year-old girls who have never packed a grocery bag or even bought groceries before. One girl once literally threw a tomato into my bag while I looked on with horror.",review,1,v3dbIu8qB2FuOJHOv_ZJrA

Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me.

Let me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.

Their cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, ""Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,"" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.

I was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn't a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, ""Das ist Deutsch"" in chocolate on the plate.  

I've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, ""You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.""  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don't tip you at all?

About half of the menu is vegetarian-friendly, with a couple of vegan items as well.  The veggie meatloaf was the best of the food we ate (not including the pie), but the tempeh in the veggie BLT was nicely prepared too.  We didn't try breakfast items, but tofu scrambler was available and looked great.  The food was delicious, the desserts were enormous and divine, and we thought the service was fast and friendly.  We were there on a Sunday evening and a Monday lunch, and neither time did we wait for a table.

I miss you so, so much out here in Boston. We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with ""World's Best Coffee"" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces. 

For years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how.

My waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up).  I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good LORD the portion size was outta control. The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy that. The meatless loaf itself was solidly good (shredded root veg with a cheesy binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood. So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list and beer. 
I couldn't get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet and Monty's has soy ice cream. WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one. I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl. That, I could do. 
My total bill came to $8. EIGHT. I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty happy, and the place was approaching fullness when I left.

2. The person who complained about the terrible service...I have no idea what she was talking about. In the 4 years I lived in Madison, I ate there on an average of once a month, and my servers were always friendly, responsive, and as prompt as could be expected during varied levels of busy-ness. 
3. The cook regularly comes out to chit-chat and joke with the customers. It's always a treat. :)
4. They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers. 
5. Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for.
6. Try the pies. And the cakes. Do it. If you can't eat another bite, take a slice home. I promise, you won't regret it!

I've never had a disappointing meal there. I miss it like a long-lost lover.",review,0,jyfHvz-9Qg_Drw3Iqhw8Mw

Actually, I take all my friends who come to visit Madison to Monty's. I once had a friend visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free + fasting for lent) with me and she had a good three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from.

This shouldn't scare off those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free to order something at the complete opposite of that spectrum. Bacon grilled cheese, donut french toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes...You name it, they probably have it. My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind.

Be prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush. Do not be deterred, it is completely worth every second.

The decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.

I got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she ""trusts me"".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.

My grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.

They seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.

Overall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.  I will definitely be back!",review,2,J-th6DPQi15QvsNxDj8AnA

You can hear the highway when you sit outside, but it's kind of like the sound of strong winds. It's hard to believe that the property is that close to downtown Madison, yet it's a farm.

My wife and I came here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed with any aspect.   Upon arrival we were met by the Inn Keeper, Pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room.   The guest area, or as they call it, the ""gathering room"" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.   The freshly baked cookies are awesome.    There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   

Our room, the ""Madison Lakes"" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   

The grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   

As my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   

After a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  

The attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   

Obviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!

The first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. 

Our room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land.

I stayed in the Token Creek room which is located on the ground floor. The room was so comfortable and clean! There was a little plate of cookies waiting for me along with water and a tiny bouquet of fresh flowers. I loved waking up and opening up the blinds to look out on the little farm that they own. It was so peaceful! 

The Inn is also centrally located (it took me 15 minutes from the time I left their inn to drop off my rental car and get through security at the airport) even though it feels like you're in the country. I don't think I left a 10 mile radius while I was there and was able to see everything I wanted. 

Every breakfast was phenomenal. Bob smoked the breakfast meats himself, ham one day and bacon the next. The eggs came from their chickens, the cheese and cranberry juice were also sourced from Wisconsin. I love eating local! We had some great conversations about food, wine, work (pre-running the Inn), entrepreneurship, and owning your own dream business.

Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  

The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  

My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.

Recently we went shopping for a project and I picked up a poinsettia for the holidays. When we were checking out the woman at the register asked if I have a cat (I do!) and let me know that poinsettias are very poisonous to cats if they eat them and she would have for my cat to get sick..or worse..because of my holiday decorating.

I agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.

Falafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.

Tan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...

Anyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!

That was, until my wife and I discovered People's bakery.  

Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  

We ordered a lunch ""to-go.""  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  

Nonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?

The eating area is quiet - no music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee. The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. 

There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change.

The ""Rapid Dozen"" is a good value, providing a diverse sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far.

Still, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel. You will find plenty of tasty dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above. There aren't, truth be told, more than a few real competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive with any I've had throughout the country.

The  minor league franchise only offers big league thrills.They realize that the college-level baseball talent alone will not entertain most people; it's old school baseball -- low power numbers and high strategy (like sacrifices and manufacturing runs). As a result, they focus on value and entertainment. 

Inexpensive tickets, good and reasonable food/beverages are a Godsend. I just came from Milwaukee -- three tickets with views that do not require binoculars will run you over $100. A crap beer (Miller brands) in a plastic bottle runs another $6.50. The food is overrated and also price-inflated. At the warm Warner Park, I was able to get a seat right behind the dugout (word is that they are County Stadium relics) for $10! They offer 18 different beers including incredible Microbrews collectible plastic cups for $3.50 or less! Besides great beer, there were funnel cakes, TURKEY LEGS, burgers, brats and MUCH MORE. Their wait staff (yes, wait staff) is friendly and efficient with your orders, so you can enjoy the show. 

Four mascots are always running around the stadium rally-mongering and adding to the enjoyment. In between innings, the festivities including a t-shirt toss, bat spin, children and mascot races and more. The PA announcer consistently appeals to the good-natured (but peculiar) kitsch that fills a family-oriented outing (refers to foul balls as wieners or frankfurters for no particular reason). Check their web site -- their dates are chock-full of promos including autographed balls, celebrities (like the Fridge, Webster, Chewbacca and more) and post game events.

When I was a kid I remember coming to many a Muskies game with my parents, but the crowds were always thin and no one was surprised when the Muskies and the subsequent teams folded.  Now Warner Park is a family destination as well as a popular party location.  For the last several years my company has held our summer outing here, tailgating in the parking lot before catching the game.  There always seems to be a huge crowd on the weekends.  

The Mallards organization provides an atmosphere that was missing when I was a kid.  Personally I love the game of baseball, with all of the intricacies of the pacing being a big part of the charm.  However, I realize that I'm in the minority here, because most of my friends find it kind of boring.  But the Mallards have really energized the park with the give-aways, the mascots, and all the other sideshows to the game.  My opinion is that if you want to see baseball played in all of it's old fashioned glory, go to Wrigley.  

The Duck Blind is the place to be for most of the adults that didn't bring children to the game.  For $25-35 it is all you can eat and drink in a sectioned-off area in the right field corner.  The food is pretty decent but the real attraction is the beer.  Led by local brewpub Great Dane's signature Mallards Ale, there is an excellent selection of beer.  This is undoubtedly why a lot of people attend, but it leads to a very festive atmosphere that is always a good time.  The only people not enjoying the Duck Blind are usually the opposing team's relief pitchers, since their bullpen is in the right field corner as well.  You can also win free tickets to the Duck Blind from US Cellular on the day of the game.  

Outside of the Duck Blind, the park is very kid-friendly, with various mascots running around and all sorts of things to keep the kids occupied.  The main mascot rides a zipline down from the party deck in the Duck Blind to home plate to start off the game and set the tone.  It's always about having a good time.  The various promotions include ""B-List Celebrity Fridays,"" various throwback nights and bands playing live music.  The concessions range from the traditional hot dogs, peanut and cotton candy to the truly excellent jambalaya.  The prices are quite reasonable and the people working are always friendly and appear to be having as much of a good time as the fans.

My general admission Duck Blind ticket was $33 for a Friday night game - but the experience of trying to get my money's worth was priceless. All-you-can-eat ballpark food (which is perfectly adequate ballpark food, nothing to rave about) and all-you-can-drink adult beverages (from a fairly extensive beer list)? Challenge accepted. 

There is another Duck Blind section that costs a bit more than the general admission. I think it includes a reserved picnic table and a better view of the game; however, if you're willing to come to the regular Duck Blind section soon after the gates open (90 minutes before the game), you can call dibs on a table in the cheaper section.

I attended a Madison Mallards game with Gwen and Dan.
(I think I still owe you guys money.) 
Let me tell ya, it's all it's quacked up to be. Ohhhhhh! 
Seriously though, I can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a ballpark. Sure the space itself leaves little to be desired. It's small. Seating is uncomfortable, and depending on where you're at the sun can be beating down on you for quite a while. BUT, what the place lacks in ambiance and comfort, it MORE THAN makes up for in pure good ole American fun. There's something happening between every inning. Look here! Now here! No over there! Hey look at that! It's like an ADD wet dream. You're never bored. You can't be! The activities and inning breaks definitely cater towards kids, but I found myself laughing, cheering, screaming wiener at the top of my lungs. Food in my opinion is only so, so. I like that there are local options but they're not great. They can't be... it's a ballpark and they're using prep kitchens. I will say the beer options are nothing short of amazing. I also dig that players typically stick around after the game and sign stuff for the little ones. It doesn't get more local than a Mallards game, except on July 4th of this year at the Hometown Classic. What's a Hometown Classic you ask? Oh, just a head to head of central Wisconsin's minor, minor, like ""is he able to drive"" minor team players.

1) friendly staff
2) fun thing to do on a nice summer night
3) gluten free food options available

I think it's really important to head in to your first (or any) mallards game with the right mind set. This isn't MLB! If you want that that head to a Brewers game in Milwaukee (NOT a Cubs game at Wrigley :p). 

As this is not MLB, the stadium is smaller and really easy to navigate through. I would imagine this would be really good for families looking for a night out. There is a decent sized kids area near the entrance as well. 

For a smaller stadium there is a really impressive amount of food and drink options. There are over 17 different beers available plus people selling Seagrams escape drinks (supposedly gluten free!), lime-a-Ritas etc. I was expecting pretty limited options for food as this is a smaller stadium but they really have everything you can get at an MLB game. Brats, burgers, chicken sandwiches, even cheese curds! There are even gluten free hamburger AND brat buns. Basically a food coma waiting to happen for anyone with celiac disease/gluten intolerance. The staff at all the food and drink stands was really friendly and quick!

Wisco fans everywhere are pretty chill but even more so here! Everyone is just here to have a good time and nobody gets really competitive about the game.

With plenty of food and drink options and great fans, a Mallards game is a great choice for a night out on a nice night!",review,2,T8b7wARakqSGC2TQhFMW-A

Great Baseball at a reasonable price. You get to watch some of the best College prospects in the country at a state of the art Minor League Stadium. A baseball junkie like me couldn't ask for anything more. 

 Like most Minor League teams, the Mallards kept us entertained with a wide variety of gimmicks. My Visit coincided with Fathers day so there was a meat raffle for the Dads that I gladly entered. I don't have any kids, but I wasn't going to let that get in between me and my meat. There was also a dance off between the Grounds Crew and a Mascot, t-shirt t throws and lots of other interesting side shows. Fans who catch foul balls can even trade it in for a free Hot Dog. Although I have to admit that its a little annoying when the PA announcer yells Wiener after every foul ball.  

 I'd like to say my day with the Madison Mallards ended on a happy note. But I have to sadly report I went home without any free Fathers Day meat.

Oh wait, I'm hallucinating again.

But seriously, this place is wonderful.  I love going here, and I do wish my backyard looked like this.

Unfortunately for me, I brought a minor with me.  Minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal, but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies.  Most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings, but butterflies?  

It's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.

If you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  

I thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and ""trust"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman and/or my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!

Minor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.

I've really only been to two official botanic gardens (mostly CBG) however I'm glad Olbrich was another to add to my list. 

It was absolutely pouring down rain when we arrived, which was actually ok because the doors hadn't opened yet, and it also gave us an opportunity to have the gardens to ourselves once we were let in. We checked in with the ladies at the front desk and they happily pointed us to the garden areas and told us about the park; they also lent us an umbrella which was nice customer service. 
We had a plan to do a loop and visit the famous Thai garden (awesome) and our idea paid off greatly. With the rain ever-present we had our own rainforest jungle to enjoy to ourselves, which made for a very peaceful experience. We passed back around to the rose garden and detoured around the flooded pathways, so I'm not entirely sure which gardens we passed through.

After getting soaked (I'm glad I had my waterproof kayaking shoes in the car) we walked through the indoor garden, which was free because I had my membership card for the CBG, otherwise it would have been $2. Even if I had to pay I would have been satisfied, it was pretty cool. They had a variety of trees, fish, painted pheasants, a waterfall, and other hidden gems I wont spoil. 

Although we didn't make a purchase, their gift shop area was pretty nice for its size. If we had more time and nicer weather, I wouldn't hesitate to make this garden a destination for a bit. It's so close to Chicago so I can't see why that would be a difficult task to accomplish.

So, reluctantly, I went in.  AND WAS GREETED WITH AWESOME.  This buffet was amazing.  They had a coconut soup which was great, all of the chicken dishes were great, they had a wide variety of veg dishes...I was so stunned and amazed.  Even though I didn't partake, they served strawberry lassi...mmm!  Finished off with some mango ice cream, I couldn't have been more impressed.

I've lived in the Madison area for the past two years, have visited many of the local Indian buffets, and have found none that equal the Maharaja standard.   Buffet dishes change on a daily basis, but you can always count on their show-stopping chicken tikka masala to be in the mix.  In addition to the standard meat curries and tandoori chicken, they always offer multiple vegetarian dishes and an array of appetizers.  

Recommendations:  coconut soup, vegetable korma, malai kofta, baingan bhartha, chicken tikka masala, mango ice cream

The staff is wonderful and always keeps plates of naan a plenty :)

We had the following: 
Chianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not juicy, risotto a bit too much salt.  Veggie seemed overcooked).

Braised Beef & Tortelloni (really good, I was told my coworkers would get it again)
Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. 

Capellini di Mare (really good, didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked for my taste).

Grilled Shrimp Caprese (pretty good per my coworker, shrimps were not overcooked, pasta a bit overcooked).

But the overall high rating for this place was more of our waiter Craig D.  Can I tell you, we've NEVER had a wait staff being so attentive for our party of 5.

Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.
  Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices.  Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare.  

We had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles.  Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well.   Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance.

What a great find! I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in. At a glance, it doesn't seem like much. Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss it. 

I'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each complete with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues playing overhead. You order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring piles of saucy goodness to your table. This place is littered with awards for their barbecue. I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) at national cook-offs.

I got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo. The ribs were super yummy. Flavor-full, but not too smokey. The brisket was nice too, not too fatty. I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang. It's sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time. Nice. 

My saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good...but nothing amazing. The sides were really tasty too. The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad either.

For sides we had baked beans, garlic mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.  However after stuffing ourselves with tons of ribs there was no room for the sides! 

We ordered out because the dining area in Smoky Jon's is teeny tiny and the parking lot is even worse.

My friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat. We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken. The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. 

I tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout. My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits. We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready.

The first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.

Oh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.

The sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.

The highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.

Off the beaten path in Madison. I had looked up this place before on tripadvisor and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is super small and the parking in front is rather limited (I had to drive around the block twice and realized that there was no parking in the back). Built as best BBQ in madison I was not disappointed. Fall of the bone tender ribs along with two sides was the meal I had. Get the sugar fried biscuits and you won't be disappointed. This place could be on diner and drives and I am glad I found it one my own! Also prices are super reasonable. No wonder why they won so many awards for there food. Best bbq sauce period.

I went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9

At $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!

Yelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!

I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs. I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines. 

The sides are also very good. The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans.

The crab cakes benedicts were perfect - not too rich, and not too heavy and very nicely presented.  The waitress was a middle aged woman who was very attentive to us.

2737,hmYAW7mhIz_o8ArencdkDw,1,2011-05-22,5,BPE-ScqznYg2hzRPWkjLmg,5,"I once thought I knew what luxury was. Luxury is yachts. Luxury is stretch limousines. Luxury is diamond tiaras and Rolex watches. Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and ""bon appetite"". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.

I once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. 

 Whether you opt for an ""inn"" or spring for a ""suite"" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. 

The ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing ""mini"" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.

Though it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. 

Now, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.

Summary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary. I would've stayed someplace else had I known the Country Inn and Suites was so luxurious. Now, back at my home, I fear I may never taste that royal tang again. Enjoy your stay here; cherish it. I know I sure did.",review,0,pfxuZwa-armTo7OgORulAQ

I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!

Each of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! 

I have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. 

We added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different. Thanks for a pleasent experience guys, I really appreciate it!

I ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry.  When she brought over the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was sooo much food!

It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.

It was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).

Safeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.

Of course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).

As for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.

Whole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone).",review,1,ETsGHcgJxldK9rlVXVB9lA

I had a very specific look I wanted, and she was able to take the cute Pinterest photos I provided as inspiration and create truly spectacular arrangements using the elements I loved.  She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!! 

The flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of. Sally also had some great ideas that contributed to our day, as I probably wouldn't have gone hunting for vintage lace for my bouquet handle without prompting.  It made a lovely addition.

I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.  

They also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!

Every department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. 

During the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. 

Local foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).

The only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. 

Although Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as ""Whole Paycheck"" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.


Tips:  

1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.

2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. 

3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied ""gentle"" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for...",review,2,USSanBgta8EEQrzPY-64Bg

And if you haven't tried them yet their marinated chicken breasts turn a normally boring meal into a flavor explosion. (Seriously, try them.) If there's something specific you're looking for, you're bound to find it here.

Only things I'd say they can improve upon:
1. The deli counter. I know it's supposed to be super good quality deli meats but every single time I've gotten some they are pretty dry. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong kind? (Suggestions anyone?)

2. The sushi area. I've never actually tried it but it always looks a little scary.

3. The prepared foods section. I tried getting a salad or something here once and the man working behind the counter had no idea what was in anything. Since I'm gluten intolerant this can be pretty important.

If I want something special, they're one of the first places I go to.

Their policy of highlighting local goods is fantastic. There are little yellow signs in every aisle to point out products made within 150 miles or so, each sign showing where the product was made and how far way it is.  When given a choice between a few products, if I know something supports my community, I will favor it.

It's a very relaxing atmosphere to shop, too. I normally hate food shopping, but it is a pleasant experience, and I feel better when I am in there.

Pada asked me some questions about my hair and what I wanted done with it.  I knew I wanted a different cut than I currently had but I wasn't sure what I wanted, so she recommended a few styles.  I picked one and she got to work.

The staff is often younger people - but they are very nice and well trained. 

The only downside would be is that it's pretty expensive - especially the non-meat products. I only get the non-meat things if I really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store (but this is typical of mini-mart type places).

We'd been using a different, more expensive kennel when we had only one dog but needed a more reasonably-priced option with 2.  Hickory Hills has been fantastic for us!

It's a great value, our dogs are EXTREMELY high energy and VERY social with other dogs.  The play times while boarding are perfect and we know they have a GREAT time by how exhausted they are for 2 days afterwards!

We usually end the stay with a bathing.  Coonhounds have short, straight-haired coats but shed terribly.  Baths usually don't hold their good smell on our dogs for long, but usually with these, the smell lasts about a week and shedding is much better in the days immediately following their stay.  They do a good job.

One last instance of AWESOME customer service: we got stuck in traffic on I-94 today but had specifically departed early so as to make it to Suter's by 6 to pick up the dogs.  We knew we'd be late, called ahead to beg them to wait for us, and the girl at the desk agreed to stay 30 minutes after her shift so we could pick up our dogs tonight rather than tomorrow morning.

The end product is packaged on site. 

That said, I took all of that with a grain of salt until I tried one of the finished products: the Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade.

Wow.  Blew my socks off.  The Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade may very well be the best coffee I have ever had.  Unbelievably complex bouquet and flavor: I detected floral and cinnamon notes followed by a crisp, refreshing finish.  On that alone, I ended up buying another four different types from JBC (have yet to try, but cannot wait to do so).

They are not exactly an underground bakery at the Farmers' Market,  but they certainly don't get their deserved props.  Oakhouse's delights include breads, donuts, scones and specialties are loaded.

There are other bakeries at the market including Stella's.  Based on the crowds and the number of reviewers on Yelp, Stella's gets all the love.   However, based on my consumption of their breads and pastries while also comparing prices and customer service, Oakhouse backhands Stella's with a silicone pastry brush (granted, Stella's has the moistest and most flavorful cheese danishes in the area).
 
I have always appreciated Oakhouse's efficiency and consistency.  They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.

My change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.

Next time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.  They may be -1 on product marketing, but more thank make up for it on their delicious delivery.

We figured we might end up staying a week (eventually did eight nights) so wanted something more homelike with a separate bedroom and living area. And we wanted to do it economically. The Grandstay was perfect and well under neighboring Staybridge, Residence Inn and others.

We had never heard of the chain before and found it on Expedia. It was perfect. Every single staff person we encountered all week made us feel at home. Anything we needed was taken care of. 

Being primarily a longstay hotel, you don't see a lot of the guests. We actually went a few days before seeing anyone else on our schedule. We felt like we owned the place. 

The lobby became our living room, with a nice fireplace and overstuffed chairs. The breakfast room was perfect for gathering with friends who also came in for a few nights. The pool was the highlight for our local grandaughter who came to visit.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. I also checked out the two-bedroom and one-room suites. The rooms were all decent size and very comfortable. Kitchenettes featured a full-sized refrigerator, cooktop, dishwasher and microwave.

Rooms include a complimentary breakfast with a wide range of choices including hot waffles.

The location is outstanding, with easy access to the freeway. It was 10 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to downtown. There are lots of really good restaurant choices at nearby East Towne, and a fabulous sports bar (Pooleys) just a block away.

Betsy M.: perhaps your parents should revisit this shelter. Help is readily available, and there is a wealth of information about each dog attached to their kennel, and you can get their whole health folder upon request. 

Additionally, the adoption fees are almost always $175, though they are $250 for a puppy or $275-350 for a ""highly desirable"" breed (which I think they rarely label dogs as that - all of the dogs we encountered, including purebreds, were the standard $175). Considering that all of their dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, updated on most vaccinations, and given vet exams, I don't think that their rates are unreasonable. In fact, they were lower than two other local shelters not related to the Humane Society.

I have often heard how they do put so many dogs to sleep here, and it does upset me a great deal. However, rather than avoid them for that, I think it's all the more reason why we should adopt our dogs and really be able to rescue them. Avoiding a shelter because of that will not help the animals. PLEASE consider adopting before you look to a pet store or a breeder!",review,3,UVp6EOBPEW63CIzejVNjWA

It was a several hour process because my bf went to meet the dog first, and then after he fell in love with him, I came along with our other dog to meet him. We had adopted our first dog from DCHS a little over a year prior to this and absolutely love her (and yes, spoil her). 

We thought the staff handled the introduction of the dogs flawlessly. They let each dog sniff out the room alone, and then had my bf and I watch through windows as they introduced the dogs. They kept the atmosphere positive and free from distractions, while slowly giving them more and more space to interact. The dogs were buddies from the start and have continued to be best friends. 

Once again, we were thrilled with the staff and the whole process. Also like the resale shop set up in the hall, very cool! 

Remember to support animal shelters and rescues! Buying an animal from a pet store or a breeder means denying a shelter animal a chance at life. Anyone who has ever adopted an animal will confirm that they are the best!",review,0,UVp6EOBPEW63CIzejVNjWA

Because I was not ripped off, everything was explained to me...step by step if needed (and I did need it - ha), nobody in this shop is a douchebag, the other customers are even nice, they don't try to rip off the ladies, they don't try to upsell me crap I don't need unless I ask if there's other crap I might need, and I'm pretty sure if I hadn't been out of town they would've let me seen the damage to my engine and walked me through the process if I'd asked so I could do my nerdy internet search on serpentine belts and motor mounts and all that other crap that was wrong.

I knew they weren't effing with me because when I bought the car a few years ago the creepy dealership supposedly changed the motor mounts. When Virginia Auto Service identified a problem with (and subsequent damage as a result of) the motor mounts, I knew it was true, and I thought about that tug in my stomach I ignored when I bought the car that told me NOT TO BUY THE CAR OR TRUST THIS CREEPY CAR SALESMAN. 

Seriously, if you have a problem with something this shop tells you all you have to do is ask and see if they can work with you - find different parts, develop a plan to do repairs in steps...ask your grandpa to come in and hand them wrenches or wipe the sweat from their brow so you can have a discount as they diligently work to repair the vehicle you neglected and ignored for over 2 years knowing full well you were driving a heap. 

When they quoted me a price over the phone I said ""THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PAY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO CHANCE I CAN PAY THAT"" while my head was exploding and my face was melting (at work). I don't know if they want this advertised, but they let me leave my car there for over a month (closer to two months) while I made gradual payments and they did the repairs. My job sent me to BFE Texas and Virginia Auto Service just let me leave it there because it couldn't be driven. That's effing CLASS, folks.

I took my car in as it was time for an oil change and I was convinced my serpentine belt was about to go.  It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous.  Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell.

Virginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine.  It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed.  It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example).

It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car.  Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special?  Yes, but it was so worth it!  Now my little one won't be getting an oil change for another year most likely, but my service advisor, Robert, asked me to please stop by every three months so they could check out my belts, tire pressure, etc just to be safe.

My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers. My omnipresent dinner companion Marcial and I, have been habitual customers since.

Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  

The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.
Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. 

The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.

Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want ""more curry"", ""spicier"" or ""hotter"" you only need to ask. 

Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.

Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. 

It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.

Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos.

Learn it. Order it. Love it.

It's mussel soup. I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. 

The pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say ""I eat wild boar!"" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.

My main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean ""American hot."" Make sure to specify ""Thai hot."" The burn is good.

You must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.

The inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.

The patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.

Finally, this is on a light rail stop, so there is absolutely no excuse not to make it part of your night out.",review,2,P8KlUtWEu-b6ZwM7XjuxBg

Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  

The restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.

Lucky for us, with 5 people, everyone picked something different.  I had the best Beef Panang EVAR!  The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  The jasmine rice was the perfect base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly cooked.

I love curry and spice, but I want to taste the food too, and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor.  For my mom, who can't eat spicy stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled to get something that tasted great.

Most of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed that this was very authentic.

They even brought out a nice traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.

Everything I tried, I liked and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not get bored!  I just wish it could hit them up on my lunch.

I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.

Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.

If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.

Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.

Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees.

This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. 

The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.

The Food and Drinks:
Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.

Appetizers:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.

Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.

Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!

Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.

Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.

Hot Pot:
We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.

Main Course:
I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!

Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.

Desert:
OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!

Will I go back?
I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.

Hats off to The Wild Thaiger.
The best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.",review,2,M93I4fHwf99NmT_xz8C0gA

Food was superb...don't see how it could have been better.  Wife had chicke curry which was excellent.  I had pad tai which could not have been better.  Food came immediately.  Steaming hot.

I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places.
That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.

My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere. 

We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool. 

For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. 

For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the ""true Thai foodie."" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!",review,3,Ksm_R7lneKDRa0yaUoBp3A

The wait staff always remembers us, and is very friendly. The service is always great.

They keep the place clean as well, and that is a major plus.

The food has always been very, very good. Flavorful, and well priced.

I always order the Merry-Mu, which is a very good pork dish. I have also recently become a fan of the Fillet, as it is better than most steaks I have eaten that were three times the price at other places.

The Coconut sticky rice could be a meal all by itself, it is that good - and I am not a rice fan. Even the garnish/filler food is loaded with flavor.

The service was great.

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

The ONLY comment (note that it's not a complaint) is that some of their servers do not have full command of the English language.

These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.

We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.

I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.

Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal.

I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! 

In previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. 

Last night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not harder then everyone else.",review,1,mR7LQurf_awsKqDK46NRew

I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. 

This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. 

As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).

Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) 
You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. 

There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. 

I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.

I have seen her through thick and thin, joys and sadnesses, 2 breast lump scares, abnormal papsmears, etc.  No matter what troubles and health concerns God presented me with, Dr. Johnstone was there to calm me, lend an ear to any and all of my concerns, and to move forward with appropriate treatments.

I was overjoyed last May to learn that my husband and I were expecting our first child.  I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.

Hesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  

After I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.  

I have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  

I would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.

I couldn't leave it in the sad little box all alone at home.

I took my new ring into a few stores to get quotes on the sizing and all of the places said I would have to leave it over the weekend because that is when the jeweler was working.  What a bummer!  The weekend is when I want to show everyone my new ring and announce my engagement.  It didn't seem like much fun to do one without the other.

Then, on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided it wouldn't hurt to check with the jewelry store across the street from my office, Renaissance Fine Jewelry.  I had a few watch batteries replaced there a while back and was very happy with the quality and speed of the service.

After showing the jeweler my ring, he was the first (and only) one to point out a few things about the ring that would cause challenges with the re-sizing process.  I was impressed.  Then he said he could I would most likely be able to pick up the ring on Friday.  That was music to my ears; I would have it for the weekend!!!

How could he do this so quickly when the other places wanted to keep my ring for 5-6 days?  I'll tell you why.  He is the guy; he IS the jeweler!  It is so nice to know that you are talking to the person who is actually doing the work!

The best part was I didn't even have to wait until Friday!!  My ring was ready for pick up less than 24 hours later!  Fantastic!

 I have used Osco, CVS,and Walgreens in the past and have dealt with lost prescriptions, crappy service, errors on my prescription labels, and other incompetencies . None of that has ever happened at this Safeway Pharmacy. The only thing Safeway Pharmacy has been lacking that the big chains have is the ability to link to all their stores, but Safeway will have that capability soon, I was recently told. 

If you want both personal and professional service that is quick and error free, then transfer all  your prescriptions from the Walgreens across the street like I did.",review,2,N-D-d1Z4UybdlkK1HxlNPA

I can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!
We were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)!

I'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! 

Let me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.

Once we were seated, we were tempted to order the ""Limit-2"" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.

Let me stop right here.

I knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!

Once we overcame the confusion of what the ""Super Salad"" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.

For the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the ""Sam-Mex"" section of the menu. According to the menu, ""Sam-Mex"" was created by their executive chef with ""the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures."" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.

Words cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.

I'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!
 
At the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as ""white chocolate tamales,"" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. 

While I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little ""cafe"" called, Sam's.",review,2,oKFqd2Lhz37jZQgI4gdbqA

The Grand Canyon frozen margarita was tangy and superb. First time I've had a margarita dressed up with bits of fresh orange zest.

You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot.

WOW...what a great restaurant and an even better experience.

First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible to describe how good this combination of sweet, spicy, flavorful and tangy this kickoff to dinner was.  You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!

Then, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!

Then we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.

And then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  Seriously...just shoot me!

I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place.

We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  

We started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. 
For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. 

Over all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away.",review,2,XxA5k_iyzf9HdvPMp_J27w

My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.

It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains. 

I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll. 

Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world. 

We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit.

Canyon Cafe exceeds our expectations every time.  You go for dinner but you stay for the chips and salsa.  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and regular tortilla chips.  The salsa is roasted and heavenly.  

Recommended: The bison burger, it is juicy and flavorful. The Verde Chicken enchiladas, love the sauce and chicken is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.

I was so addicted to it one summer, I walked over there maybe 3-4 times a week to order it.  It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind of Royal Family flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.

But whatever.  I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.  This was great for some serious people watching ... mostly tourist wondering why Bianco is closed at noon, but attempting the door anyway.  They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good for them!

Anyhow, back to this sandwhich.  Its unbeleivable and pretty large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice.  They have a pretty good selection too.

My only complaint is that they open too late (for morning coffee -- although once i guess i looked thoroughly disappointed that they weren't open yet early on a Sunday while they were setting up and gave me a free coffee-to-go anyway!) and they close way too early.

Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision.

But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.

Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking ""Made in China"" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.

Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.

As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said ""He is just really fair.""

St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. 

I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. 

During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. 

Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. 

There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.",review,13,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

The Basilica is a beautiful piece of Spanish colonial architecture run by Franciscan Friars, crowned with bell towers, palms, and stained glass windows.

The Christmas altar was lit with candles and bursting like a heart in love with the reds of dozens of poinsettias.

Midnight mass lasted until 2am, but was so rapt with happiness, that few seemed to mind or notice. Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

The mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.

The celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.

By 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.

Many, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy.

One could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. 

A final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world ""beautiful"" to describe any building in Phoenix.

The story of the various Native American tribes is an incredibly solemn one that is all too often glazed over in your average grade school American History course.  I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.

Thankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an ""Art Museum"" by many instead of an ""American History"" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, ""that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls"" then you've totally missed the point.

The first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.

It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.

I was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...

The Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. 

The founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.

Most people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.

So, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all.",review,19,VDHUtEnPh54OJiYow91d3A

It was average price-wise for museums these days so I don't knock it for that. When you fully explore every part of the museum I felt it was worthwhile.

I don't profess to be an expert on Native American history (save Geronimo) so if your knowledge is a bit lacking in this area then this is the place to help fill in the gaps. It was definitely a lot of learning for one day but enjoyable and eye-opening at the same time.

The mock school area of how native americans were forced to integrate was probably the most fascinating part for me. As much as the fact that it was only a few decades ago that the school closed. You usually think of this in the Wild West over a hundred years ago.

It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?

4127,Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw,1,2011-06-19,1,Hc9vz7P8DGALkCqYt0yqtA,5,"I am a parent of a student entering 6th Grade at Arizona School for the Arts. I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.

I will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  

My son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  

We were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.

And, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  

He loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.

Then the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.

The school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.

This school is really a dream.  It's an educational opportunity I would recommend to any parent.  I think my son would write a similiar recommendation!",review,2,x4eIi_YiwKj1pzcspeLt-Q

Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

There were 5 of us checking in and we had a small room that was going to be tight but we were going to make it work when the girl behind the counter let us know that the suite was available and it had more room. She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. 

The room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. 

The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. 

There is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said ""Hello?"" There was no one around.

The decor and room are well kept while the historic aspects are left intact.  The lobby and rooms were beautiful!

The pool was surprisingly modern. It was lite with cobalt blue lights which added a very relaxing feel for our night swims.  

The staff went out of there way to make sure we enjoyed our stay.   While we were swimming the security guard----I think his name was Denis ---checked on us.   He answered many questions we had about the hotel and things to do in downtown Phoenix!   The staff (Bob at the front desk was super nice too) was very friendly and knowledgeable which really added to out overall experience :)

I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour? Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy (?) brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massage/shampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it.

As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. 

If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. 

Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor.

You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).

The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?  

And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.  

Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it. 

So that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.

Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  I finally found myself in the area and dropped by for early lunch and was not disappointed.

To the tourists and over cautious it may not look like the best area to be but have no worries.  This part of town is just old and run down.  You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  Have no fears.

As per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.

My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.

The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.

Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.

I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.

I have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.  Can't wait to take any visitors I have here.",review,5,gg_OKjOAl_vVmdh5ZETuiw

Arriving about 11 AM today, a Tuesday, this nice, fairly large place was already roaring busy!  I did get seated right away, but they were soon full, with quite a crowd in the waiting room by the time I left.

For this visit I decided on one of the four white board Lunch Specials of the Day (in addition to the Tuesday Lunch Special contained in the printed restaurant menu).  This was a Pablano Chile Relleno and Pechuga Asada (broiled, boneless chicken breast).

My friendly server gal showed up right away with good toasted tortilla chips and a cup of their spicy hot, pureed red salsa.  Next came a small bowl of their Soup of the Day, which was Conchigliette y Carne Deshebrada in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  (Having soup included witl lunch at no extra charge is one of things that make this place special!) 

At the right time, my big platter of the main courses arrived.  Everything was beautifully placed, & the chile came stuffed with Queso Oaxaca, breaded, deepfried, and treated to some delicious toppings.  Along side was the tasty, good-sized chicken steak plus generous servings of creamy tasting, cheese coated refried beans & fluffy Spanish Rice.

Every bite of this meal was absolutely delicious, and again I wish I had brought my camera along to show it off, but suffice it to say that I'm so glad I came to this great restaurant today!     :-))

I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.
From the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.
After what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.
Then fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.
Even after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.
Everything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.

The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean.

I was there last week to see bird cage (la cage follies)! It was a fantastic performance an I was trilled to come watch another show at this theatre. The actually theatre is pretty small. So small in fact that the orchestra is actually placed in a separate room on location and microphones transfer the live music out to the main stage. If you are sitting in the audience and look up you can see the director and lighting experts working their magic. The sound engineers are located in the back of the theatre which is the usual spot in most theaters. The seats were kind of uncomfortable but there was a person in the lobby trying to get donations for new chairs so I can't really say much about that.

As for the theater, it was surprisingly small, which turned out to be a real treat as the proximity to the actors made the production more enjoyable rather than viewing it from a distant balcony or 60 rows away.  There is a very nice bar, and there was live music prior to the show.  At intermission, cookies, chocolate squares, and brownies were $2 -- about the price range as other theaters in the area.

And who better to accompany me than the lovely Terry T. Incidentally, Terry has seen the production multiple times, so I was concerned this wouldn't hold up to her expectations. I, on the other hand, was just excited about seeing this musical (and staying out late on a work night, Tee hee!)

Now, I have to admit I started comparing this production against the movie. So I initially was thinking, ""Wait, Fontine was brunette"" and ""Hugh Jackman delivered that line differently"" before I allowed myself to be consumed by the musical. Because it truly was beautiful and masterfully played out on the modest sized stage. It received Terry's seal of approval. Bravo!

A couple of things I think really contributed to my enjoyment of this musical were 1) the lovely senior citizens who were bused in, and their darling commentary during the production; and 2) killer seats, front row stage left.

You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!

Anyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.

Oh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.

On top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid.

Upon entering, I'm greeted by the nicest lady I might have ever met. She admires my plaid jacket. (BTW, there's a Yelp sticker on the door!) After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice. That wonderfully kind lady was sad to see me leave because she wouldn't get to see if I liked my food. Waiting at the LR station, I was glad I picked up an extra pair of chop sticks because some crazy-eyed man was looking at my bag. Although it had been about 10 minutes from the time I received my food to the time I walked back into my office, the food hadn't really cooled down all that much. Nice!

This is a sparsely decorated gem in Midtown Phoenix. In an area full of lunch only, counter order spaces, one would think this wouldn't be welcome. I love a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable. I've had the Oyako and Teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious. You definitely wait a few minutes for your food, and that is a good thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it, like Tokyo Express does. 

Good food alone though, won't garner a five-star review for a rice bowl. What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered.

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.

Problem is, I essentially live in North Scottsdale and she is in Buckeye. Using Meetways.com to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good local places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is true for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great reviews and decided to check this place out.

We both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said. Very nice portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, though is the service. An older woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there. 

Her service was absolutely delightful. When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think I was rude if I started eating before she was served. A moment later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us that she ""has pull around here"" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks. 

I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an ""outsider""

The only negative was that the parking is very limited, but then again I did go during the lunch rush.

Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! 

We had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!

I picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! 

P.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not AmEx or Discover.",review,0,A7B8l4bO15tVkpD-5TD2zQ

A few things to know about me: I live downtown, I know good food, I DO NOT eat at Chili's... ever. When I say something is good, I mean handcrafted, fresh ingredients, bursting with legitimate flavor good. 

But enough about me. You want to know about Blue Fin, so here's the lowdown: 

- Super clean digs and friendly, wonderful personal service from the most adorable little ladies.
 
- Tender (non-bouncy) char-grilled teriyaki chicken thoroughly marinated in a not-too-sweet sauce that tastes slightly fermented (in the best way) with a touch of sesame. 

- Great steamed veggies that melt in your mouth served with perfectly cooked brown rice.

- Flavorful miso with generous chunks of tofu.

- Wonderful house made sauces. My favorite is the sweet and sour sauce, the kind they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full of fresh ginger.

- Affordable prices, generous portions, and great for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.

However - after a friend of mine told me that I was crazy and that the food was delicious, I had to try it.  Now I've eaten there three times this week.  

I should also probably mention that I usually hate all things teriyaki - it's disgustingly over sweet and I can't understand why people like it.  BUT this place has it right - it's fresh, not out of a jar, and made by the sweetest people you'll ever talk to.  Try a chicken bowl with extra veggies and brown rice - you won't be disappointed.

 Yet here it stands in 2013 still going strong. Which makes me really happy.

I love when local business can do great!  They have always been great ,very friendly service and fresh food. The panko breaded items are light and feel healthy. All the vegetables I get here are  always crisp and fresh.
I guess it is because, they take pride in the place. Something you do not always see. I believe that they have lunch specials every week day.
However , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.

They have soup, and sushi, salad,etc.
Lots of nice cool drinks. If the weather is cooler(below 90) you can sit outside and enjoy the light rail going by.

I am a creature of habit so I get the same thing every week: A spicy all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl ($6). The portion is SO big. I have never been to any restaurant that actually over serves the meat portion. I typically find myself wanting a little more rice to finish all the chicken with. I love the way the chicken is cooked and the spicy teriyaki is just the right amount of spice. 

I will also sometimes splurge and get some dumplings ($2 with tax) which always come out very hot and taste great with their soy based sauce. It's not a traditional dumpling sauce that I love but it's still pretty good with the dumplings.

The service at this restaurant though is what pushes me to give them a top notch rating. The people here are just such genuinely nice people. They are very helpful and they get your food out quick.

- Baked Mac & Cheese: Amazing! The cheese sauce is decadent, thick, creamy, and has a wonderful garlic & southwestern spice flavor.

Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.?).  He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was.  

I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday.  It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular.  Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait.  It's not a big deal.

I would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup. It is amazing. Unfortunately I recently found out it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing peanut sauce.

I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so.

The portions are always great, and you honestly CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists. 

Stay away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open really late on the weekends too.

The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed the artistic ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly.

The space is quite small, especially on nights when there are musicians performing, but that just adds to the intimate and welcoming atmosphere.  The staff is extremely nice, friendly and very accommodating, and the clientele are the same.  

On my first visit there I had the olive bowl (watch out for the olive pits!), the paprika turkey sandwich and their unique daily soup special-- chipotle salmon chowder.  The turkey sandwich was delicious and the soup was a bit spicy (duh, it had chipotle in it!) but very interesting, with flavors I've never experienced.

I've been visiting the Paisley since it's days on Roosevelt street, and it's easily one of my favorite spots in the city. 

Everything about the place is just good- the people, the atmosphere, the food. The International Eggwiches- egg sandwiches on a bagel- are great for breakfast; any of them will hit the spot nicely. Lunch is always a tougher choice because there are just too many good things on the menu. I am particularly fond of the Hummus plate and the Paprika turkey sandwich, but most everything else has been amazing as well. (I'd stay away from the Champs d'Elysses sandwich though, it's much too heavy on the brie) The daily iced tea is always unusual but usually good, and the soup of the day is never subpar. The last time I was there, the not-so-traditional potato soup was heavenly. 

The coffee and espresso are great, although I can't say too much about the frou frou drinks because I don't drink them. I imagine they'd be great too, with as good as the coffee is.

I felt kinda bummed that time cause I had no idea they didn't serve alcohol, but I did find out that they were byob. The band was cool. Food is good. Tea is good.

I went during the day recently and had a really good lunch and was able to have a really chill lunch meeting. Our waitor for lunch was super friendly, helpful, and had a good pulse on when to check in and when not to. 

The best part was afterwards we walked out back and the woman I was meeting with asked if I knew about the small houses/cottages out back. Apparently, they are cottages from the Japanese Internment Camps in California. And they were some of the larger ones for families. The man who had invested in the project (I guess the owner of Paisley came up with the idea and pitched it to this guy) led us around and told us about the space and how they were going to be renting them to artists. Kind of cool, I thought...cause in some ways incredibly dark and reminiscent of something horrible...but at the same time...a way to kind of capture and convert that energy and remind people of the atrocities that have been committed when motivated solely by fear rather than logic and reason.",review,4,MwJVSTsUB-htphNZaIC43g

The Paisley Violin is gills full of progressive and retro designs and a charmingly simplistic menu of favorites, including eggwiches, croissants, sandwiches, salads, and plates containing VERY fresh ingredients like organic vegetables, cheeses, cured meats, hummus, and a variety of sauces to name just a very minimal amount.  The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing.

However, the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard.  According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  The other three are TBD.  It is a brilliant concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  I absolutely cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.  

One other note: The Paisley Violin is no longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.

The first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn't pretty inside, it's divey, a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed, but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you. Good drink, great food, great music, great atmosphere, great service.
The toasted pesto brie was delicious, the brie was not overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended.
Now the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not in a ""nice"" part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange neighborhood in front of a stranger's house... sorry.

After reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cool wigs. I drove us around the block three times, literally . With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave , it's not exactly easy to access. 

Finally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says ""Wigs"" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.

We walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. 

I was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said "" Are you going to buy a wig today""? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!

Although the parking was atrocious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfect wigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!!

The Chips & Salsa
Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.

MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO
I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.

With it's rediculously flavorful shredded goat and sheeps cheese (mizithra), and the warm brown butter and garlic sauce, this meal is decadent - but without the pricetag!  For $16 I can get this entree, with salad to start (their homemade ranch dressing is to die for), warm bread with garlic butter, dessert (spimoni or sherbert), AND a glass of wine.

The decor is also amazing - so unique and eclectic, it's got a really fun ambience - complete with dining trolley in the center of the room!  There are private rooms for even small dinner parties (I had a private room for a dinner of 4 once, and it was simply luck of the draw).  

The old arcade games (think pacman) in the lobby waiting room are entertaining as well.

Our food was good, I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  I'm not a foodie, so this is not about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it. 

The refills were on point. The only negative was that all of the tables around us were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, would be a tight fit with the possibility of him bumping in to us.

You still get a giant hot loaf of sourdough bread with real butter, salad or soup and entree for $7.99. Originally, our waiter said the ice tea and desert (scoop of decent sherbert or average spumoni) was extra, but I guess he was feeling nice and he offered those items for free. This cheese is really good when combined with the butter and it is always one of my fav dishes and never had a bad meal at any OSF across the land (west of Nashville only).

The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no apology needed. She asked us if we needed them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked in storage which was very helpful.
Natalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited that we ate in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free baked chicken and pasta. It was better then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good.

Yum. I also appreciate their convenient variety of snacks and candy, even Tylenol if you need it. They serve coffee too, although I haven't tried it yet.

Its a pretty basic sandwich shop, that caters to students and employees at ASU's Mercado buildings on Van Buren, and to a lesser extent the UA College of Medicine across the street, and Heritage Square. Its too bad the storefront is so hidden - you have to know exactly where you're walking or you'll miss it, and its not at all visible from the street.

I'm not sure what upsets everyone so much about the prices - this isn't Subway, their sandwiches are much more substantial, and you get chips (plain Lays potato chips) in the bag with your sandwich. Most of the sandwiches are between $6 - $7, but that's what you'd pay at Corner Bakery or really any non fast-food-chain or sandwich shop these days. Also, it's a local business for goodness sake, in downtown Phoenix no less, so consider the fact that they represent exactly the kind of economic activity this part of the city needs. There's some cheaper pre-made sandwiches and snacks for sale if you're really so concerned.

Despite having just compared it to generic fast food, the service really is quite fast. Unfortunately, there isn't room in the tiny shop for any tables, but you can order a sandwich and they'll have made it in 2-5 minutes while you wait.

The owner, Tom, is there almost every day, and most of the employees are very nice and will remember your order if you go there frequently.

The girlfriend got the chili, which was really good in no small part due to the fact that the meat used is brisket. Genius. I had the steak and rib combo. Steak was cooked to order and tasty. But the ribs are where it's at. Tender baby back ribs with thick, sweet bbq sauce. The meal also came with 2 rolls, mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies.

5556,pd13qgNj1y40zVj4xkfQJA,0,2014-04-19,0,--E7VzdirFrgCIPVF4ghLg,5,"The reason I went into this credit union was really because, compared to banks like Wells Fargo and my former bank MidFirst, they had a GREAT interest rate on a simple checking account (for balances over 5k at the time of this review).  I have to say my absolute first impression when I walked in was not super great. No one really seemed all that interested in helping me. Maybe it was just me, it could have been that they had JUST opened their doors and were still getting situated..I don't know. At any rate I left there less excited about banking with them than when I walked in but it did not take long to turn me into a HUGE fan. I can't see myself going to any other bank again thus far. Customer service has always picked up right away whenever I have called,  I even sent them an email and I am not sure it took them 10 minutes to reply.  They have relationships with several other credit union branches that I can walk into and make deposits and transact business with, so even though they only have one ACCU branch near me who's hours are not convenient for me there is another CU about a block that they co op with that is open on Sat and I can go in there. That stuff is all really great but what really did it for me was their website and mobile app. My, now former bank, was not even close to this easy to use and ACCU's website is actually very useful  to me. I am a bit of a tightwad with my cash and like saving my money, this website makes it SOOO easy to track my spending and help me make adjustments. I also used to have to have a paypal account to easily send money to people as my old bank just used to have your everyday  bill pay that every bank has. The payment system ACCU has rivals PayPal in my opinion, for how I have used paypal in the past anyway. Like I said my overall first impression was not super great, I was actually sort of leery about closing my regular bank account after my first meeting but now I almost can't wait to close it.

Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.

I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again.

The way they were throwing the sandwiches together reminded me of Primanti's in Pittsburgh. They had a no nonsense-we know what we're doing-kinda attitude. There was no frufru on the menu, just great meat with a few ""specials"". I got the skyscraper which was a great, fresh bun piled with corned beef and pastrami.

I was walking around this side of town and stumbled upon this deli and I decided to pick up some lunch for myself and my boyfriend who works in this area. Well I walked in and it was empty which usually isn't a good sign but it was 2:00 PM and I figured the lunch rush had come and gone by then. Besides the lack of people I did notice how clean and organized everything was, I liked that! I spoke to the gentleman behind the counter and asked him what the most popular item was and he said the Pastrami or the beef brisket. Since the boyfriend eats anything I got him the Brisket and he offered up some fries with that. I had a hard time understanding much of what he was saying like types of bread for the sandwich or whether I wanted a pickle with the meal but no big deal. Well to put it lightly the Brisket was friggen amazing.

Now, you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty fast, which is understandable considering the big lunch line. Fries are the default and you have to speak up if you want something else. Mac and cheese is good.

A few things really stand out about this church. First, the music. The volunteer choir performs breathtaking choral pieces every Sunday. Even after attending this church for a year, I'm constantly impressed by the skill of the choir, soloists and organist. The service commonly features guest musicians such as the Sonoran Brass Quintet.  

Secondly, the current pastor, Pastor Larry gives great, contemplative sermons that really parse the text of the scripture. The staff and congregation are always friendly and welcoming, and the church is involved with several charitable works in the community, such as the Justa Center

Over the past few weeks I have been to events, meetings and banquets in the South Ballroom and West Hall.  The West Hall looks clean, modern, and is impressive with a gigantic atrium entrance on 2nd St. and seemingly endless escalators up to the third floor.  

Audio visual equipment here is top-notch and they spare no expense with the A/C - holy crap it was FREEZING!  Signage for the restrooms could be more helpful as I found myself guessing where the loo was each time.

I'm not sure who does the catering here, but I found the food to be above average, but not outstanding.  Think ordinary salads (chicken cobb and a southwestern caesar), your typical rubber chicken banquet meals, a breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon, Starbucks coffee etc.   For dessert we had some kind of cheesecake turnover sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar - yum. 

If you go in the near future - definitely check out the ongoing construction. The top floor of the West Hall boasts an impressive view of the North and East expansions where you can see all the cranes and construction going on and more detail than you can imagine.",review,3,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA

This is dorky - but I know you'll totally get me if you've ever trekked across countless useless square feet in heels, lugging countless brochures and promos you've been given; if you've trampled over mounds of used paper towels in a depressingly lit, dingy bathroom; if you've ever had to sit in a hard plastic chair for an hour+ and listen to a rumple-suited guy drone on and on about synergy and sales figures; if you've ever been subjected to ugly corporate art ... OK, I'll stop there - but I LOVED the Phoenix Convention Center!

With a swell new renovation, its gorgeous in contemporary rust and sand and other deswet appropriate colors (god, I'm glad Arizona finally got away from the ""sunset"" color scheme of pink, purple, orange - blech!) and fancy tile entryway. It's clean, modern and has TONS of windows and open space. When you enter the West Building from Second St (the entrance by Starbucks), you're sort of swept up, up, up to the sky, and it really makes a statement (the entire entryway/first floor is open all the way to the top).

The seminar rooms have all the hi-tech gadgets needed for presentations, and the AV/Tech guys were professional and prompt if there was a problem - and, might I add, some of the most well-dressed techies I've ever encountered. No band T-shirts, visible tattoos or bears* here, man, it was all long-sleeved button-down shirts and dress pants; impressive!

My favorite part? Wicked-comfy chairs in the rooms. No hard plastic and metal legs, no cumbersome, heavy, office-gray uncomfortable torture devices. The chairs were super sleek - those mesh-back, rolling office-desk chairs you always see in design studios and architecture offices. By the way, did I mention the backs *recline*. I'm totally serious. I'm a super antsy chair sitter - I sit up, I slide down, I cross, re-cross, pull my legs up Indian-style, under me, I turn (doubly insulting to speakers if the chairs are squeaky)... I can never sit still in an office chair, but these bad boys made me feel like a grown up finally as I could sit quietly for a full hour.

Bathrooms were incredibly nice - large-tiled floors that were actually clean, small-tiled sink backsplash in contemporary colors, soap AND paper towels in full supply AND the automatic water faucets ACTUALLY all worked! It's a convention center miracle! A full-length mirror for making sure your conference appropriate attire looks as nice as you thought it did at 5 this morning. Nice, floor to ceiling, all-glass (frosted) doors with the long bar, brushed steel handle (what can I say? I'm a sucker for a cool bathroom, just read any of my reviews)

What else.. it's right off the light rail, of course. I found the entrance easily, no wandering around an entire city block looking for the right door. Up on the third floor, the windows provide a great view of the city streets - p.s. what's with the towering TMobile ad painted right on the Bank of America building?? Oh yes, super hi-tech looking TV screens outside each room that display in color the current and upcoming sessions - helpful, because it never fails that someone moves or changes the signs and you're left wondering if you're in the right place. 

Also, I liked that the convention center chose to work with a caterer who uses compostable plastic cups made from corn...say what?? And they have recycle cans alongside regular trash cans for all those empty water bottles.

OK, the one thing this place does have in common with other convention centers is that it is FREEZING. Of course, that is to be expected no matter where you travel.

for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.

fresh ingredients, so good.

My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.

they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment? oh yes pls.

I was really glad I ended up choosing them because my experience was really great. 

To start with, when I emailed the online quote request, I got a prompt - and very thorough - response from Jeff. Unlike some businesses that respond to quote requests with a zillion other questions, Jeff took a stab right away at specs/materials and an estimate. This made me so much more likely to engage and really saved me a lot of back-and-forth (which I just don't have time to do during the work week). 

When I picked up the signs, they were great quality and the work was as I pictured it. I also thought the prices were reasonable for custom signs.

I've been a customer for decades, having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal. drum outside the original East Phoenix location.

I now frequent the Central Ave. location and the food is still as good as it's always been.  

If all that matters to you is ambiance, this is probably not the place for you. Honey Bear's is all about the food.

Someone complained that the pork was too soggy.  Another that the pork was too dry.  HOW can it be both??  The pulled pork IS ""soggy"" because it's JUICY!  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE for!

Someone actually dissed the barbecue sauce!  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west, and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found.  

The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth), I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs.  So, I tried the spare ribs and, while they are good, they just don't compare to the baby backs.

I had never tasted ""collard greens"", so I decided to try them.  Now I'm hooked.  Since I liked them so much at HB's, I ordered them when I went to Notorious P.I.G., another barbecue restaurant. I had to throw those away...they were loaded with vinegar.

I will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork, pulled chicken, and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants).

We were able to relax on the couch, continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips. I was giddy with pleasure. 

To top it off, the bathroom is unisex... and sneaky. Behind a wall without a handle, you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way. While waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside), a couple men profusely apologized. Evidently, they thought they were in the wrong bathroom. Little did they know.

After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4.75 stars
Service - 3.75 stars
Overall - 4.5 stars

This is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.

The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?

Our main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. 

Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  

Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.

My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. 

I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.",review,5,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA

My husband and I went in on a Saturday night for a few glasses of wine.  Once we saw the desserts, however, we knew we had to try it!  I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was very good (it wasn't the Harvard Faculty Club, but then again...what is?) and my husband selected the coconut pie.  Both servings were huge and covered in whipped cream.  They were fantastic.  Finally, a place to go for dessert here!

We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was amazing.  He offered us complimentary tastings of two delicious dessert wines and then even offered us a complimentary mini cheese sampler with an amazing sheep's milk cheese.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was laid back, kind of cafe/bistro-ish but still modern.  They were playing The Food Network which I absolutely loved...I've never seen that in a restaurant before! It was a great touch.   The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.

They have a wonderful wine dinner with four courses for only $55 a person!  I'm eager to attend one in the future and I definitely plan on going back for dinner in the near future.

Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the ""wine by the glass"" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.

The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  

I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.

The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle.

Husband and I went here for a late dinner last night on our anniverary-eve. It was a Monday, and there were only two other couples there, so it was nice and quiet. The ambience is relaxed and warm, and our server was attentive and informative, but not smothering.

We started with a three-cheese plate. They have a long list of cheese varieties from which to choose. We got the Truffle Tremor (goat), Abbaye (Sheep) and Three Sisters of Serena (cow). It comes with baguette slices, pear slices, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, almonds, and a delicious candied-syruppy-dried-fruit-and-nut combination.

I ordered the duck for my entree, and it was superb. The duck breast was excellent, but the best part was the blue-cheese-potato croquette and the diced mango and poblano relish. I could have licked my plate. 

We were too full for dessert, but they looked great.

I loved that you can order half-glasses of wine. It gave me a chance to taste a couple of different kinds without a)breaking the bank, and b)getting so sloshed that I couldn't drive home.

I enjoyed everything about my experience here. The only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal, but when it came, it was actually pretty small (perfect size for a starter). Husband insisted that it was just enough, but I would have preferred he have a bigger main course. But I digress.

Expect to pay upwards of $50/person if you go all out and order wine, starters, and entrees, but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share. The portions are adequate, but not really big enough to take home leftovers.

One of the things I love to do at Cheuvront's is the tastings.   Wine tastings, cheese classes, beer tastings... it's all yummy, PLUS super-fun, and very informative too.

Cheuvronts has been through a couple of different chefs, but the food is always consistently made from ultra fresh, premium ingredients.  My favorites include just about any salad on the menu, and the salmon, mmmm.    

The cheese selection is, bar none, the best in Phoenix metro.   I didn't say it was the cheapest; but it is definitely the best selection of some of the most fantastic cheeses I've ever had. 

I highly recommend going to a cheese class to learn more about cheeses!   Ken Cheuvront is extremely knowledgeable and has travelled to most of the places where the cheese is made and has personally met most of the cheese makers.   So that makes for some great stories which make you appreciate the cheese even more.

There are great happy hour deals on both food (starters) and beverages, and on Sundays and Mondays the happy hour prices go ALL DAY.   Unbelievable deal!

My initial review of 5 stars has not changed.  Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a ""regular"" entree.  It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  

My favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.  (Really, any of their mac and cheese options are great).

I have been meaning to go for ages and finally a group of friends wanted to go out of dinner, two of them which now live downtown, and I recommended Cheuvront. A half hour ride from the Mill Avenue stop and I was there. 

A bit chilly to sit outside but looks like excellent outdoor seating. The seating is well spaced with wine storage along the back wall and a well stocked bar in the middle (God and I both love a well-stocked bar, or at least I always say ""Thank God, they have a bar). The wait staff was cordial without being too personal (I look at dining as I'm out to eat dinner with friends, not really out to make new friends, at least until I have a few drinks but that is whole different situation....ahem). 

I started out the evening with a basic mojito made with 10 cane rum. A little too much sugar syrup for my taste and could use more lime but wow, served in a full size glass and a kick like a mule. One of my fellow diners had the white sangria with fresh basil and wow, that was a keeper. I'm definitely having that next time. 

They have a huge selection of cheeses from around the world and we ordered the three cheese appetizer plate (the waiter asked if I wanted to pick but was happy to pick a selection for us, and I love to delegate) and the pork empanadas with orange marmalade. The cheese was good and I noticed they also have another book where you can order wine and they just pair it with cheese, how cool! The empanadas, to die for, I will order that again, ideally along with that sangria with fresh basil. 

Dinner was the duck breast rubbed with coffee and ancho chili pepper and served on top of I don't know what but it had a crispy grilled crust on the outside and it was nice and cheesy (seemed like some sort of rice and cheese mix) on the inside, and it was wonderfully presented. I actually had the recommended wine pairing and wow, it went so well together. A rich red wine that offset the spice rub on the duck breast perfectly. 

We ended the evening with coffee and desert. The coffee was okay but they should consider serving coffee roasted at the Cartel coffee lab in Tempe (which I love) as the coffee here was just...coffee...which was a shame when the rest of the meal was so great. Ideally they should bring everyone an individual french press so they can let the coffee get as strong as they like to drink it. I would also recommend a thicker cream, even whipping cream (unwhipped) since it provides that sense of luxury that goes well with this place (I had that at Mucho-Gusto and became an instant fan). 

For those of the more intellectual persuasion, I noticed this place is in walking distance of the main Phoenix library. So you can go pick out a good book on a lazy Sunday and then walk over to Cheuvront for some wine and cheese and feel like the perfect elitist, before you ride the light rail home (okay, this is my ideal lazy Sunday and I've always dreamed of being just a little bit of an elitist - I'm not perfect).",review,1,aIAjAU-6NH583EkQ6E9KRw

Our server, Drew, was absolutely wonderful. He was friendly, charming, and not hard to look at. He made us laugh and made sure our meal was perfection. He provided some of the best service I have received period, which is a lot to say because I go out to eat frequently. I will definitely be returning and bringing my friends and requesting him.

The food was just as great as the service. We went for restaurant week, so we each did the $30 dealio that comes with three courses. I did the poached pear salad, salmon, and the peach cheesecake. We also decided to try their mac and cheese because we had heard good things about it. The mac and cheese (we got the pesto and spinach one) was TO DIE FOR. I am salivating just thinking about it. I love me some mac and cheese so I am always excited to find really good ones. They also had a couple other options to choose from that I definitely will be back to try. My salmon was cooked to absolute perfection. The cheesecake was also amazing. 

My girls and I left totally stuffed but totally happy.

My only issue with this place was the bathroom. It was a little odd, but hey it had a toilet so I can't really complain.

They have a parking lot and they are also right off the light rail so they are super accessible.

I have lived in CenPho for several years now and have only just tried Cheuvront in the last four months or so. I mistakenly assumed it was a pretentious wine restaurant but truthfully, it is far from it. 

My first foray was at a Sunday Italian cheese tasting they held over the summer. Around $15-$18, you sampled pre-selected cheeses and had the option of ordering a wine flight with it or anything else to drink. You could also order other food. The tastings began at 3pm, and the best part was the restaurant officially opened at 4pm which began their 4-6pm daily happy hour. Yes, DAILY. Great HH selection, too, between the drinks and food. I am a fan of the one cheese plate for $5, margherita flatbread ($6, I think) and their goat cheese phyllo pockets with a balsamic sauce. God, those are to die for. On the dinner menu, we also tried a bleu cheese mac and cheese that was delicious. 

Since the first cheese tasting, I have been to an American cheese tasting, and most recently a Spanish cheese tasting. It was at the American cheese tasting that I discovered a favorite goat cheese with the consistency of a parmesan. Cheuvront sells their cheeses for about $1.50 an ounce which is very reasonable. I also had a fantastic red sangria that I had to stop at 2 for. So good.

They offer their regular menu during the tasting also. I tried the fig and Brie bruschetta. A great sweet paring for the French wines. I also had a prosciutto and Gouda topped with onions and capers a great pairing for savory wines.  The table I sat with also had a ham and gruyere grilled sandwich which was fabulously amazing.

My cute guy set up a reservation for a Thursday night out. We arrived a little early after he realized Cheuvront would close at 2100. We wanted to be sure to he our cheese and wine fix to the maximum.
I was impressed at the extensive cheese list. I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect
, but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree , but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout. The staff is wonderful and the ambience is romantic. The only two things would change is a later closing ...& not to serve dinner while the cheese course is being savoured. But because the meal and experience of Thursday night date night was so amazing ...

 I like how the women get into the theme, with cutoff denim shorts, black tanks and tees and AC eye makeup. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful but I want to make a special shout out to Susie. She took outstanding care of me. I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.

I especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.

Here's a tip: go at lunch. I'm sure the dinner crowd is exactly that - a crowd. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definitely going back. Thanks Susie for taking care of me!!",review,3,ifJnVqqdA5tPczYSHZ5aDQ

I have made it a habit to come to Cooperstown prior to ball games and concerts for over 15 years. I anticipate keeping that tradition for years to come.

So many of the sports themed bars and restaurants in this area are lost to the culinary Sonoran graveyard.  Alice Cooperstown still stands for a reason.  The staff is friendly and fun loving, the menu diverse and in unison with the rocking roll and sports themed decor. 

I usually get the BBQ sampler or the incredibly stacked nachos, but tonight I went for the simplicity of the Tom Brady Burger.  It was ""Spot On."" 

The bacon was crisp and plentiful and the burger itself was perfectly cooked with a smoky charbroiled taste.  The fries were fresh, crisp and spiced perfectly. 

I opted for two Kiltlifter beers, from local microbrew Four Peaks Brewery.
The beer was available on draft served in nicely chilled her glass. 

Giant screen television monitors are strategically placed throughout the cavernous restaurant so every seat can view the game or games.

If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are free and obviously on the Sunday I went no charge. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, good entertainment also at least on this day.

There's really not a bad seat in the house, restrooms and food are conveniently located throughout the building and while the ladies room often has a line at the end of an event, when everyone is leaving at once, according to my wife, its generally not too bad.

Unlike other cities that built arenas on the cheap and now have to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars to build new arenas or risk losing their team (cough, cough, Sacramento), Phoenix should be proud that US Airways Center was built right to begin with and the City has continued to maintain and make improvements throughout its history.

It was my first time at US Airways Center and I will definitely be back if any other artist I enjoy comes to perform. I used the park and ride on Washington just a few blocks East and rode the light rail free about 45 minutes before doors opened. Once inside the lobby I must have dropped my ticket because I had them in my pocket, (don't like bringing a purse to concerts!) and within a minute or two of talking to one of the security guards and an employee at the front another woman came up that worked there and when she found out I had dropped my tickets she told me she picked them up and put them in the back inside the customer relations office. She walked me back and I had my drivers license out that had my name that matched the one on the ticket and without any questions she checked the names, handed them to me, and I was on my way! Talk about total perfection from the staff. That will teach me to use something other than tiny jean pockets next time! 

The seats had a perfect view, section 105 row 19, and we got to look right down at the stage and had a lot of room to dance as we were on the end of the aisle. The show was outrageous and a great experience all around. 

A few small side notes, the bathrooms are huge and clean. The food all smelled pretty tasty but I was not in the mood to stand and eat, and I'm sure it wasn't cheap either. Drinks were priced a bit high but I was driving so I didn't have to worry about opening my wallet anyways! Once the show let out it took a matter of seconds to exit the building and get to the light rail station to go back to my car. I guess a lot of people had the same idea because at least 100 or more of us were waiting in a huge group, and once it arrived and the doors opened we were squishing in but everyone was still on such a high from the exciting show that we were laughing about it.

There are different vendors that sell food and drinks in the halls past ticketing. The variety depends on the event.

They are not big on mixed drinks or coffee options, but you're in downtown Phoenix..... Once you walk out you have lots of options, so just have a beer or a coke and bide your time ;) 

Parking is EASY. It's literally surrounded. If you've never been it's easy to get scared when you're driving up because you start to see EVENT PARKING signs blocks away, but fear not! There is plenty of parking directly across the street North and West of the building.

My bed was comfortable and room service cleaned everyday, placing things just where I left them if they need to making the bed or cleaning the sink. I was able to control the heat in the room! Big screen tv with hbo. Coffee maker in the room, iron in the room and FREE WIFI were a plus!

I also loved the workout room. While small, they had a few machines that could keep this girl happy. This room was next door to me and I barely heard the machines being used on the other side of the wall! Thanks for thinking of me! The wokout room was also clean. Breakfast was great and full of hot/cold selections. Not only pastries, but egged, bacon, cinnamon rolls, cereal, oatmeal, biscuits, ect.

Location wise, this hotel was only 7 min walk to the convention center. It is not far from the airport. I would save money by riding on the metro rail and walking down if you have carry-on, as the $24 dollar shuttle was not worth the distance to/ from the airport, but that's just me being cheap.

It's something everyone should go to at least once, even if you think it's not for you.  And don't buy into the tales of these evildoers that wander around Yelp complaining there is no culture in Phoenix.  The musicians are talented, at least in this tone-deaf Yelper's humble opinion.

We've gone to a few performances.  The Mr. prefers the Classical series which is enjoyable even if sometimes I want to take a nap.  I prefer the Pop series.  And mixed in with this are a variety of holiday performances (the Hocus Pocus Halloween performance was really entertaining!)  On the plate for next Spring...an Elvis tribute.  Yep, I'll be there.  Also Simon & Garfunkel and McCartney/Beatles tributes, and music from the 30's & 40's.

I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!

Oh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever.

Here's a couple of tips if you want to go. 
1) Bring cash for parking. I'm not even sure where you would go if you didn't have any cash to park. It'll cost roughly $12 to park in any of the nearby structures. 
2) Keep an eye out for discounted tickets.  the 2013-2014 season has been exceptional in regards to special offering for tickets.  This is probably because of their lack of real musical direction while they search for a new Music Director/Conductor.
Try the symphony's website or living social for deals.

I wondered if she was more truly a verbal maestro than a musical one.  She made me realize how good it is to live a life immersed in music, something redemptive.  Not clogged with bitterness or bottom lines.  Stress?  Sure.  But in the service of something eternal.  The music.  Which lasts when administrations and trends are gone, and flashes in the pan are revealed as pyrite.  Speaking of eternal, the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it ""Beethoven Five"".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece, and those words resonated because I was careening across a stretch of Arizona's ruddy desert at that point and I felt her words echo the landscape.  She was more lyrical and relevant and hard hitting with her prose than many self-styled prose gurus and 97% of talking heads.

It really doesn't get any more quaint than Bar Bianco, with their converted early-century brick house, hardwood floors, candlelit alcoves, and old-world porch.

Its great to see people just lounging without being in any sort of hurry to escape anywhere.  This is possibly the rarest sight in Arizona.  Moreover, there is a balance of young and old, spread throughout its interior foundations and its courtyard like a discharged honeybomb.  When you take a moment to realize the history behind the square, you sense that the mood probably hasn't changed very much in an entire century.  Being able to look to your acquaintances in closely neighboring restaurants and bars within Heritage Square gives a really cool sense of cultural and social community; this being the second rarest sight in Arizona.

Additionally, Bar Bianco makes it a habit to serve savory and rare-ish wines, my favorite being the locally produced Dos Cabezas Sangiovese.  The price of a bottle is pretty reasonable, although if you wait to order a bottle at The Restaurant, it is priced cheaper for some reason.  

Bar Bianco also used to serve Quilmes beer from Argentina, but apparently discontinued this practice.

A date and I were there for about an hour and half while waiting for our table next door. Everyone describes it as tiny and they are right. The bar itself is immediately to the right in a very small room. So after ordering a drink for each of us we ventured into the rest of the ""house"". It opened up a bit more and we found a seat along some of the windows on a padded bench. After finishing our first round a waitress came over fairly quickly and asked if we needed anything else. More drinks and a plate of prosciutto and another round were ordered. By this time we were able to move to a large wooden table that had become vacant. 

The food came out and it was perfect. Buttery crostini and paper thin prosciutto. Perfect amount of food to wet your appetite. The atmosphere inside the bar was very laid back and soothing. The prices weren't too bad either. 4 drinks and an app came to $20. Not too bad I thought. This would be a great place to go hang out on any night and not have to worry about a table next door. Our Bar Bianco experience ended when they came and got us for our table. Those nice little touches of not having to run over to make sure you didn't get skipped are great.

I discovered this place thanks to some friends at work. Since my first visit, I've never been disappointed. I always order the Chicken Picado Pita and it is always so delicious! Just the right chicken to pepper and onion ratio. The pitas are fresh, the tzatziki sauce superb and their french fries are magnificent -- crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth buttery inside. Although I've yet to venture outside my own menu choices, they have plenty of items to choose from and I'm sure just as delicious.

The staff is friendly and accommodating. The parking is limited if you get there on a busy day, but otherwise it isn't too hard to find a spot. Like others have mentioned, it is right on the light-rail route so the location is great too.  They even have a small patio out front where you can enjoy your food and the Phoenix weather (when permitting). 

If you are out and about in the downtown area during the week or Saturday, definitely give Athenian Express a try. It is one of those affordable, quality food gems that you shouldn't miss out on.",review,3,oIVsVM8H273aoT1JUmsDIg

""PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW"" and ""SO HELP ME, I WILL RIP OFF YOUR LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS"".  Ok, that last one might not be totally related, but clearly, I'm scarred.  For some reason as soon as you tell me not to touch something, I'm all ""TOUCHY TOUCHY TOUCHY!""  and that does not work in most museums!  They get really pissy if you reach for the Mona Lisa.  

So the Arizona Science Center is PERFECT for those who share my tactile proclivities.  YOU CAN TOUCH EVERYTHING! For those who are germ phobic, plenty of hand sanitizing stations to keep you clean.

We spent about 4 hours, you could go longer with older children, but if you have toddlers that might be your max.  You can leave and come back with the wristband, in spring or fall it would be perfect to go in the AM, have a picnic, and then come back for additional visits.

The Planetarium and the IMAX, as well special exhibits like the Star Trek the Exhibition.  We paid extra for the IMAX and Star Trek, but decided we didn't have time for the Planetarium.  That is on my must go back for list.   The Star Trek exhibit was good - but I'm a geek, so I wouldn't recommend it for a non-Trekkie.  I thought it was well worth it.  The IMAX was also great - my mom loved it since it was about Santorini, Greece, and she's been there.  

But the highlight for me were the hands on exhibits.  All of them were great - and I actually learned some stuff!  I could go on and on about each of them, but I really think if you like cool stuff, touching things (THINGS, NOT PEOPLE) and have a sense of adventure and wonder, you would really enjoy a day here.

I've been both with my nephew and with fellow ""big kids"" aka adults. Every time I go, I have a blast and it's not necessary to borrow your friend's child in order to find an excuse to go. The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. 

During past visits, I've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! 

Currently, they have an exhibit called ""Forces of Nature"" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won't give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather! 

Just recently, I was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called ""All About Me."" They've been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows! The amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it's an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I ""x-rayed"" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn't wait to come back and explore some more. 

Before I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here. Adults Night Out is just that, where you can explore the exhibits, attend an Imax show and have a fun night out sans any children!

(They only allow so many people in at once.)

I found the exhibit a true art form.  I watched the 5 minute video of how they preserve the bodies and what goes into the poses and am amazed.  I think the audio is a must for $5 more.   I learned a lot and would go back. Oh, that's right.... I am...for the Annual Yelp Party!

I have to say if I had children I would definitely take them to expose them to this amazing insight to our bodies.

Fascinating and amazingly preserved human bodies.  This is the first time my wife has encouraged me to look at naked women.  Honestly, if you have a chance to visit before the exhibit leaves town, go.  Soon.  Now would be good.  This special engagement will be gone after May 31, 2011.

There are a number of regular exhibits that are geared toward kids, many of them hands-on.  Several school bus loads of kids were there when we visited.   We did not spend much time near those areas.  You might try the late afternoon/evening, especially if you have your own young ones.  We returned again at a special event for adults only.  The ""kid"" zones can be entertaining for adults too.  Though, to a lesser degree.

The Dorrance Planetarium was oh, so cool.  Literally.  After rubbing shoulders with the mobs of people it was nice to just sit and ""chill"" in this well conditioned room.  I highly recommend the ""Black Holes"" presentation.  Unless....like my wife, you experience MoTiOn SiCkNeSs.  In which case it's a nice cool place to shut your eyes for a spell.

We would bring the kids, and although they don't have a TON of stuff for little ones, it was a very happy medium for us fact-hungry parents. We had passes and would bring friends with us all the time who loved it.

We went again, just the two of us, for the Yelp event. And it was amazing. I loved the little hands on exhibit that they had, and the way they have the exhibits set up is just so perfect.

The one downside is that not only are they kinda pricey for the whole family, but then they charge for the extra exhibits on top of it. If me and my little family of 4 wanted to check out everything, it would easily cost us a hundred bucks. 

But even with that, the planetarium and staff pull my rating all the way up to 5 stars. You can see the prices online, and it's not geared to very small children.

We got our Pirate tickets affixed our wristbands and took the elevator straight to the third floor exhibit. It all starts with a intro movie and a great entry into the actual exhibit. There were so many artifacts from the Whydah (whee-duh)!  My favorite was all the booty the pirates had plundered!  One liked the pistols, cannons, cannon shot and replica ship. The younger boys liked all the items they could touch and pick up!!  Our daughter loved the ship's bell and all the gold artifacts, especially the jewelry! The oldest of the kiddos liked the gift shop at the end of the exhibit. There were lots great pirate trinkets for all ages! I felt like a kid again, reading ""Treasure Island""!

The science center had other great exhibits on the other floors as well. The youngest boys liked the Monster Stomach!  If you've been to the science center you know why, if you haven't, you'll just have to make a visit and find out for yourself. 

The Freeman exhibit was also great!  Our kids enjoyed the pipes & valves, but had trouble putting them together. Not a plumber in the bunch! The adults tried to stack wooden blocks to create standing masterpieces, not an architect in our group either. 

Another draw was the SkyCycle!  A bicycle suspended above the first floor along a thick cable. Each adventurous ride will cost you $5.00 as a non-member, $3.00 for members. We enjoyed watching everyone ride across the sky.

Each wall, of which there are many in this maze of an exhibit has video playing. This means that although there are people wandering through, you'll be able to glance left or right and see the video on another wall. Obviously, the more crowded the museum, the more difficult to see, but it only takes about 30 minutes for the video to complete it's cycle.  You can stay and see the parts you may have missed as it starts over on a continuous loop. 

On exit, you can buy a book and video. I don't recommend the video, it seems to have been shot while the exhibition was open to the public so you have people wandering through the DVD scenes as it's being filmed. It's not so much that they obscure the view, it's just simply too distracting.

In addition to seeing Van Gogh, Yelp provided some light snacks, a scavenger hunt, and entrance to most of the museum and the Planetarium.  Thank you, Yelp, for arranging this.  it was the 2nd Yelp event my wife and I attended and can't wait to see more.",review,1,Dkbm7KWrg01U0We4aVCKqA

I'm so glad I waited to review this place until today (we went Friday, July 13th) because I remember my husband and I thinking  that, aside from the wonderful Body Works and Grossology temporary exhibits, some major improvements, additions and renovations were in order... And I was SO impressed with all the nice changes since we last visited with our kids (then age 3 and 7; now 6 and 10) a few years ago. 

ONE CAVEAT: If you live in the Phoenix Area, definitely opt for the membership, as just TWO VISITS make it worth the cost. (3 or 4 visits, which is completely reasonable just for the summertime will make the price even more attractive).
Another complaint I have is the check-in time for non-members (20 minutes on line just to step up to a cashier; all the while my kids had to endure the taunting view of the outdoor water/balls exhibit and I had to subsequently endure, ""Why is it taking so long?!"").

Other than that, this place ROCKS!

We circled the museum until we saw Heritage Parking (park there for the most convenience and price). Bring your ticket to the check-in counters inside the museum and they will validate your parking. Unfortunately, they will not cover 100% of the fee, but they will discount it. I believe we parked for 4 hours and I ended up paying $5. Heritage Parking also takes credit cards, so that really saved me a big headache.

We went on a day where there were huge crowds from school field trips, so it was hard to maneuver around, and super busy, but after the afternoon was over, much of it cleared out and we didn't have to wait in line to try out different exhibits. There were tons of interesting things to see and try out, Iuckily my 3 year old was interested, but I would not bring anyone younger than that, or else they will become bored.

It's unfortunate that the shows are to be paid individually and not included in admission, but I can understand. There was so much to see and do I was getting dizzy. I'm glad that they covered everything from physics, physiology, chemistry, geography, meteorology, technology, and much, much more.. it looks like they have a good range of subjects and it didn't look cheap.

I was able to get a membership (with my today admission counted in), for the 3 of us for $85, but it sucks that you have to pay for parking every. single. time.. too bad they don't just add full parking fees into the admission. I guess if you go to the Children's Museum of Phoenix about a block away from here, you can park there and walk here, and then walk back when the day is done, but it's just a lot of work.

So that's what this entire edifice is all about. A shrine to scientific exploration. A Mecca of mechanical, natural and experimental marvels. But it's all broken down so the kiddos can appreciate. In my case, THIS kiddo can appreciate the digestible nuggets of information organized into pods of focus.

I can definitely recommend the Forces of Nature exhibit. It runs about every 15 mins, and takes you through tornadoes, forest fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and the extreme Arizona heat. It's all simulated with fans, water, shaking platforms, lights, and heat lamps. Pretty rad, and the kids will definitely want to do it a few times. I know I did.

Be sure to check out each floor. Take that elevator all the way up. If you're antsy, it's still going to take you a couple of hours to get around to everything. With more discovery in your bones, you're going to need the better part of an afternoon, or even close to a day. There's a cafe there, but I didn't get to try it and can't vouch for it.

As is the case with most museums or places like this, the exhibits come and go. Some are meant to be temporary, others will be around for years. So visit the website to see what you're in store for. You can upgrade your ticket if you're interested in some of the bonus features. When I was there there was some kind of sky-cycle-on-a-cable you could pay to ride.

Glad to share that this is sooooo not the case!  My son is 7 now and just this week, I've taken him twice to partake in Snow Week where for the past week, they've special activities planned for each day. 

The two days I was there, there were tons of special activities on the daily schedule and these special activities were so well planned, my son and his friend enjoyed participating in them so much that both days, we spent minimal time on their permanent exhibits!!!!

Whoever was in charge (maybe it was a team?) of Snow Week did an absolutely thumbs up (both thumbs up in fact) fanta-excellent job!  Both my son and his friend enjoyed the science experiments on the first floor theater, the making of mini bobsleds out of giant spuds (Idaho potatoes) then racing the, down mini sled tracks, mini ice hockey (ice frozen on cookie sheet then min ice hickey sticks made from Popsicle sticks and pucks made from penny covered with electrical tape)- genius. My son and his friend played for almost an hour with this simple contraption!

Scented balloons were a big hit, as was making the gingerbread house. 

Aside from the special activities, my favorite section (see, and I'm a grown up- I think) LOL. Big kid at heart, that's me- is on the 2nd level where the kids can hands on learn about mechanical properties. All of us (including me) can spend hours there going from one hands on exhibit to the next. 

The permanent exhibits are an added bonus. Why do I say that?  Because they usually have a special exhibit or special activities planned that you can spend your whole day doing those!

I'm really looking forward to see what's next after Snow Week and now that I know how much fun Snow Week is from going this year, next year I will be taking my son for sure and plan on being there from open to close!!!!",review,3,ru8p3RTlk8f9LB_3zLXURQ

Research has shown that positive relationships between ""Littles"" and their ""Bigs"" have a direct and measurable impact on children's lives. They are more confident in school, better able to get along with their families and peers, and less likely to begin using alcohol and drugs.

One of the reasons this program works so well is the dedication of the matchmakers. Their extensive interview and screening process ensures the best matches possible, which are based on similar backgrounds, interests and hobbies. 

What I've discovered during my time as a Big is that I get as much out of our relationship as my Little. He's an awesome kid that just needs a male role model in his life, and I am proud to be the one to be able to provide it. We've bowled, gone to the Arizona Science Center, the planetarium, watched movies, sometimes we just hang out and play video games.

The commitment they ask for is just a few hours two to four times a month, for a minimum of 6 months. Of course the longer the better - many matches remain friends for life.

My father used to tease me that I was ""born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;"" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.

From their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their ""new"" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends. 

The red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it.

Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.

As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. 
This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. 

Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.

Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. 

What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. 

Here's my suggestion.
Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.

The food, ambiance, service are all superb.

I've written a fair amount of reviews and this one is likely to sound gushy enough to make my wife jealous.

Their chips are made fresh.  Not made fresh that day.  MADE FRESH FOR YOU, right when you order them.  They charge $1 for a very large basket.  Salsa is free.

The only thing I am not a fan of there is their red salsa, but thier green is so damn good and so damn hot.  I pay, but its worth it.

Ok, now the beans. Oh my God!  They are so creamy and perfect.  I highly suggest you order a side to go along with your chips.  I live a solid 30 miles from this place and will drive here JUST for the beans.  My wife loves beans so much.  Its almost unnatural.  She could seriously sit down with a plate of beans, thats it, and be happy.

She get absoluely giddy when she knows we are gonig here.

Rellenos.  Oh my God AGAIN.  I can't even describe how wonderful they are.  They really are unlike any other restaurant's I've ever had.  First off, they are huge. Secondly they use a batter that fries up so light and puffy.  So you have this slightly crisy, kinda fluffy exterior surrounding strips of relleno pepper with the most luscious, ooey gooey cheese in the center.  I dump a ton of their green salsa on top and just go to town.  All you'll here from me are moans and sighs or delight once it is put in front of me until I'm done.  They actually continue a god 30 minutes after I leave as I replay the feast in my mind.  WOW

The chicken enchiladas are perfection, the machaca is oh so good, tacos are cripsy goodness.

Here's my order...  Chips with green salsa and a side of beans while I wait for my a la cart cheese relleno and either a chicken enchilada with green sauce (not salsa) or a machaca taco.  Depends on what mood I'm in.

The food was delicious!  The two kinds of salsa were both fresh and delicious.  The red was my favorite of the two because of its smoky flavor.

Each of our soups had a full chicken breast inside. The broth was amazing.
Our meal was amazing and more than I could eat.

For busy nights, they have 3 bar tenders serving, 2 in the front and 1 in the rear. 

The crowd: If you're visiting or new/ transplant, compared to flashy Los Angeles, hipster Seattle, and melting pot NYC's lez scene (to name a few cities), I've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians, about an even number of femmes, tomboys, androgynous, and a small handful of ultra femmes.

but...Wow, i didn't realize how lucky i was to beat the lunchtime crowd here. I have been meaning to go here for several months, but like our first reviewer, can't go out of my way when during their normal biz hours.

but, i had heard so much about it, i like green so much that i jumped at the chance to stop by after a rare 10 a.m. downtown meeting. i got there at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking (by plenty i mean only three of the lots 10 or so spots were occupied), but, even though i knew what the building looked like from driving past its closed doors so many times before, i still cruised right on past while heading south on 7th st. i went into the second entrance to the lot that wraps behind the building and oops! that's an exit only. i had to do some fancy manuevering and a 3-point-turn (haven't lost my skills since driving test '98 - woot!) to face the right way and get into a spot.

normally, i would be pretty annoyed at all this, but i was too excited to try a refreshing vegetable-heavy wrap on such a damn hot day. and that's a wrap! did not disappoint. while i waited for my companion, i looked over the menu and was surprised at how many of the items were hot or grilled. i was kind of heartbroken until i saw the daily special, chicken salad with avocado, lettuce, veggie mayo in a flavored wrap (all the tortillas are flavored, making the choosing process that much more painstaking).

once i had my order on lockdown, i checked out the art on the walls of this early 1900's house-turned cafe. not my taste (the subjects were robotic kind of monsters with drippy limbs, i thought of pink floyd the wall, while my friend likened it to what a 15 yr old metal head stoner doodles during class) although they had skateboard art, also, which was better. then i picked up a java magazine and flipped through it...basically, if you come alone, you won't look like a loser, there's plenty to keep you busy.

blah blah blah - long story short, the wrap was great, although on sides menu i chose ""house chips"" thinking they would homemade potato chips, but were just store bought tortilla chips. lame. friend got the pasta salad which was much better, i recommend that. plus, they cut the burrito sandwich in half and have bags and plastic wrap right there at the drink station, so you can easily get two meals (hence my being happy at round #2) and i was happy i didn't have to 
 a. wait in line forever just to get my wrap travel-appropriate

I've only met you once, but it was love at first sight... I found you easily - on 7th street just north of McDowell and lots of parking in your private lot made me happy. I walked in and felt comfortable immediately - very casual, laid back atmosphere and welcoming staff. Since my lunch companion was a little late, I had time to observe the place, the menu, and even read a New Times that was out for your patrons. A few things I noticed during my wait:

1 - you are incredibly fast and efficient!
2 - you have smoothies on the back of the menu and they look delicious!
3 - you don't mind when people special order
4 - I didn't hear any whining or complaining at all while I was there

The list could go on, but my friend arrived and we ordered.  I had the 'Veggie Jackson' wrap - no onions or rice, add tofu with a side of fresh fruit. My friend had the 'Very Brady Clubster' with a side of fruit as well. We both commented how delicious our wraps were and the fruit was good too! The veggies in my sandwich were grilled to perfection and the combination of flavors from the feta and balsamic salsa blended just right.  I felt like each bite was a party in my mouth.  Sounds cheesy, but I swear, it's true!  Serving size was perfect and so was the price!  (Everything on the menu is $6.95 or less and even if you add chicken or tofu, it's less than $1).

It's going to be kind of a hike for me since I'm moving further north, but I will be back for sure...

See you soon, my new love!

:)Gabi",review,7,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw

I had the Prince of Thai which I really enjoyed. Just spicy enough for my tastes. I tried the pasta salad as a side and was impressed that it wasn't oily or had too much useless stuff on it, simple is good.  At $6.95 I thought it was a heck of a lot better than a drive through or a sub sandwich.

I see complaints that ppl think it's expensive, me thinks not. If you go to any other lunch time ""quick bite"" place you'll pay about the same amount (or more), unless you're talking about a franchise fast food spot.

I had ""The Fin"" it was a tuna wrap, but not canned tuna, cooked tuna full of marinated flavor, accompanying it was a mango salsa, purple cabbage slaw and garlic white rice in a red tortilla. I opted for the jalapeno cabbage soup of the day as my included side. For $7.25 

The tuna was great despite looking over cooked, the soup was truly great. I do not like soup but I liked this soup, it was creamy without cream and had a great spice note.

Throw in authentic southwestern Mexican dishes served quickly and a great bakery with a huge variety of fresh Mexican sweets and this place deserved five stars hands down.

My favorite items are the tamales (pork)with the green sauce, gorditas (gf's favorite), nopales (that's cactus and any self respecting southwestern Mexican restaurant will serve these) and the Mexican sweet breads (not brains, yuck). The food comes fast and my orders have always been right. There is a salsa bar that's always stocked. It's a dine in or take out establishment with no servers. There is also a small butcher, or carneceria, inside for finding cuts of meat for making fajitas or other tastey things at home.

Not a date place but perfect if you're looking for something with a couple of friends that will fill you up and not break the bank. It's on 12th Street and Van Buren so be aware of the area.

All the food I had here was incredibly fresh, delicious, and flavorful.  It seems that everything is made in-house, including the tortillas, and it shows.  Prices are great too - I got two tacos and a burrito for about $12.  I also love the huge charcoal grill in the middle of this place, although it does fill the restaurant with smoke on occasion.

What I ate:

Lengua taco - super tender and fantastic.
Carne asada taco - extremely flavorful and just really awesome.
Chile relleno burrito - a MONSTER made of delicious.  The only reason I was able to eat this and two tacos is because I'm a fatass - I'm pretty sure a normal person couldn't even finish the lone burrito.

I also tried a bite of someone else's fish taco and it was awesome.  Most places deep-fry their fish for tacos, but La Tolteca grills it, which gives a different flavor and texture that is absolutely fantastic.

The salsas are also really fresh and delicious.  Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.

La Tolteca is awesome, and it's unfortunate that I didn't find it until after I moved out of Phoenix.  I'll be sure to stop by every time I visit though, as this place is worth it.",review,2,cXhs6BawP6L_V59zKb9dOw

The carnitas burro blew me away.  Fresh, homemade flour tortilla makes a huge difference.  Carnitas were incredibly moist and tasty. Fresh guacamole, great salsa.

The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

This place was flippin' good! I mean, gosh darn! How the heck did they just do that? Each bite made whoopee to my taste buds and stayed around afterwards to cuddle! It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!

Okay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.

The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of ""best in Phoenix"" and they all left agreeing with me.

I confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more ""super"" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.

The carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!

The latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.

Before you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery).

Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but ""Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" This place is amazing. 

One of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. 

We looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those).

7816,apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ,0,2012-08-28,0,C8WDu7GCllkrTjlD4kGWdg,5,"MUY AUTHENTICO!!
When you see los chonchos eating here, you know it's good.

I always avoid Mexican restaurants because everyone does this slap together something that's so standard and has no flavor unless you get some standard bright red sauce. WELL NO MORE!!

My friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. 
When you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.

I had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalapeños (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with habañero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.

Sin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.

My friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (""ha-MAI-ca"") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! 

Water is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. 
Extra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. 
There's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.

Super Inside Skinny: That's freshly made molé in bags at the grocery counter.

Cool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. 
I usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!

So overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca.

Of course I had to rate it 5+ stars, it's been an excellent trip every time I've stopped by, and enjoyed some of the best Mexican food I've had.
La Tolteca, is an all in one stop for what you need food wise. They have a small grocery section, to where you can even get yourself a 40-quart tamale steamer, obviously you can use it for other uses as well. They sell masa, and anything else you would need to make your own dishes at home. 
They have an extensive bakery with fresh baked goods that they are continuously bringing fresh baked goods out. They make cakes, flan, tres leches, and many other delicious desserts, and can customize an order for you and make you anything you'd like. They even have samples available, and of course I'm one of those guys who goes hog wild on samples :)
They have a meat section too, to where you can get 1/4-whole chickens, ribs, and other meats. They make fresh guacamole, queso fresco, and many other delights.
Their food selection is huge, and it would take me awhile just to try everything from the 5lb super torta, he super burrito, soups, breakfast items, and many other foods.
They even cater!
Today I had my usual, three mini cabeza tacos, refried beans, and horchata.
Their cabeza is the best I've had. It's juicy, crisp, flavorful, and not greasy in one bit unlike most places that make cabeza.
The beans were delicious and moist. They weren't dried out of pasty like you may find at some quick stop Mexican restaurants or chains.
Horchata is great no matter where you go.
Prices are inexpensive no matter what you get, and for someone on a budget like myself, it's a great deal. You can fill yourself up on food and not break the bank.
I highly recommend stopping here and trying something new, it's not some Taco Bell so don't come in here expecting some Americanized garbage. This is the real deal.

The Tacos de Papa are addictive. 

The Ceviche Tostada is something that I dream about. 

If you are into burrito's check this place out, awesome big rolls of home cooking. 

The Carne Asada is delicious and so is the roasted chicken. OH MY GOD. 

Try the Elotes, all the grilling is over mesquite charcoal imported from Mexico. This is where I fell in love with grilled corn. You will thank me.

IMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings.

The cover to the events are reasonable and drinks cheap. They also typically have complimentary appetizers which is always welcomed with long lines. 

Entertainment (besides the always interesting people watching) usually consists of some performance art, magic tricks, DJs spinning beats, and my favorite, a burlesque troupe (Provacatease). At times a little kooky, I always find it enjoyable and have a great time at these parties. The crowd is varied and full of fun weirdos. I love it!

You're best best inside is if you can catch a seat at the corner of the counter.  You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.  

We arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.  

I had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.

Just a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.

People.  Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.

The picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.

My only beef (Heh.

Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.

The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are ""rustic"", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!

You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!

We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.

The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). 

All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.

THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE

When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.

We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.

(PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)

Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.

The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.

THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS
We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.

MOZZARELLA
The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.

GNOCCHI
If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  

LEMON CURD
We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.

$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.

I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, 
June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

Thank you Marshall Shore for letting us know about this place!  We were a party of nine for Easter dinner last night - we filled the diner itself and ordered 1 of everything on the menu [2 of certain items].  There were 10 dinner items and 4 dessert items.  We passed the dishes down the counter to each other.

The menu is strictly vegetarian, but Payton keeps a few meat items available for hard core meaties - like my daughter and I who shared a heavenly fettuccine bolognese.

Each dish was superb.  I have a really hard time deciding on a favorite, but I think I'll go with the Fava and Steuben beans served in agave nectar with a walnut pesto.  My wife and daughter are going with the Beluga lentils, parsley and celery leaf.

Also having been a fan of Digestif and Caffe Boa, during Patyon's residency, this is his best work, yet. I am floored by Payton's creativity and fresh-style every time I'm at the Welcome Diner.

I haven't had anything yet that left me wanting more. Each dish is well thought out and perfectly executed. Payton manages to capture the purity and freshness of the ingredients that so many chefs in town manage to murder. 

As excited as I am to have Payton around the corner from my house, I am even more excited and anxious to see what his next spot will deliver. It's only going up from here folks and if your not on the Curry train yet, get on. 

If you're one of those people who enjoys bland food and thinks that every restaurant needs a nice view, please stay out of our neighborhood and stop yelping about how Noca is in a strip mall.

Solid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint.
They opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of ""disasters"" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour.
I had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end).
Best burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain.
The red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty.
Both the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.

They've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.





What are you doing?

I've been to Welcome Diner three times in the past two weeks.  I've sampled the lemon ricotta pancakes, the Holy Puerco special and a breakfast biscuit sandwich.  All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...

I love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.

Food is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.

AND THE FOOD! I have yet to try something that didn't make me smile. It's hard to pick a favorite dish but personally, I love the Kiltlifter braised pork biscuit. The carolina mustard sauce that's made in house, is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. And the made from scratch biscuit it comes with, is too good for words. 
Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane. And even though you clearly hear the bell dinging from the kitchen and everyone inside scream, ""HURRICANE!"" each time you order one, you just can't seem to figure out how you got so tipsy; they're sneaky little guys.

When you're seated inside, you are a part of the whole Welcome Diner experience.

I most recently had the smothered pork plate, which was pulled pork with a beer and onion gravy over a bed of jasmine rice, with sides of delicious collard greens and house-made poblano hush puppies.  It was a heaping plate of food for $11.50.  The next night, we returned, at my niece's request, and I had the Port of Call burger.  It was yummy beefy goodness with perfect fries on the side.

The food here is the star, but the workers and cooks are all having a great time, really genuine and fun, and overall make the experience even better. 

The Port of Call burger is exactly what you want: perfectly cooked, coated in cheese and onions and whatever else, and the type of meal that will leave you just barely too full.

The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, if you can unhinge your jaw to take it on. Get it with melted cheese, and go even further by tacking on gravy and bacon, if you think your heart can handle it.

The fries are fantastic as well. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients loads the food with flavor and makes it well worth it. They also have some amazing specials, and: their biscuits.

They have a vegan po-boy sandwich with fried avocado that I could eat everyday, it's just that good.  They use the freshest veggies, no really, so fresh that it was probably picked that very day from the Garfield community garden.  That's right, fresh AND local.  I also can't get enough of those delicious collard greens!  I was impressed with the staff because they knew exactly what was vegan (right down to which bread I could eat).

On to the food...fantastic. I had a veggie burger with fried avocado on the side. Life changing. My boyfriend had the classic burger and fries, and loved it. I can't wait to come back and try the vegan po'boy.

Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.

The diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.

We got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.

We so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.  Whatever you do, find a way somehow to include a biscuit in your meal here.",review,2,MLNXzph9nlCXGiSuv5G5Yg

I used to drive all over the valley depending on what mood I was in, and now I pretty much just go to the Welcome Diner. They have about 9 seats inside and quite a bit of patio seating. They have a few nice big outdoor heaters too.

Some things I love

-Excellent quality food sourced from local vendors
-Amazing amazing drinks. They make their own bitters, grenadine, squeeze their own lime juice  and even have fresh herbs to put in. Each one I've seen made is with love.
-Good service, fun atmosphere
-Almost everything is made from scratch
-Specials that are (always delicious) experiments, not leftovers.
-Catfish Fridays (Try the sampler!)


I would say price wise it's not necessarily cheap, but not expensive. Average plate will run you about $10, but considering the quality and atmosphere I have no problem paying it!

PB&B burger
Bacon Blue burger
Veggie Stallion (housemade edamame and mushroom veggie burger with housemade ricotta)

The kitchen is very small. This vintage diner car was meant for one cook. So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other. The food is top quality as well. My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork. 

The best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights, picnic style seating, and friendly staff. I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night, but he was so friendly and knowledgeable. We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car.

1st patronage: we were able to sit inside the tiny trailer and the guys who were working that day were awesome. Great customer service, made us feel known and welcomed! That day I enjoyed the Welcome Burger with no regrets! Husband got the Big Jim & was very satisfied! 

2nd patronage: I popped by for an iced coffee (they serve Lux brew) , and the gal working (can't remember her name now, but she's got blue hair ;) was super friendly! She even hooked me up with a refill for the price of free, I was like wow, these folks are nice :)

3rd patronage: we weren't feeling meat, so we tried the Vegan Po' Boy...was surprised at what a delicious sandwich it was, nothing poor about it! 

Their fries are the best around. Their coleslaw is distinct. Their service is appreciated. I'm looking forward to enjoying more meals here. 

I'm busy and really don't have time to write reviews, but I'll type one up for a local business I want to support! They also use all local AZ grown ingredients folks.

These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] 

The Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]  
They make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) 

My favorites:
Anything with their fried chicken. 
Anything with their biscuits. 
Their french fries are  hand cut and fabulous. 
They smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. 
Their burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). 
Their salads are lovely and tasty. 

They offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later.",review,4,usQTOj7LQ9v0Fl98gRa3Iw

Welcome Diner is a cute restaurant with plenty of picnic tables outdoors. They do have some indoor seating, but it looks to be quite tiny and every time I've been is in a group.

It's awesome to be back in the ""south"" and see iced tea on the menu. I kept requesting more, and the cool tattooed chick just brought me out a pitcher, a whole bowl of lemon slices and a smile.  That's hospitality. 

I had the ""KOKO"", a hand breaded, fried chicken breast in a homemade biscuit with some kind of homemade remoulade, baby greens, tomato and a side of vinegar-based red coleslaw. Awesome. Friends had a deep fried avocado (vegan) po-boy and the other gad the fish po-boy, both of which looked great. 

Definitely coming back.

Edit:  BTW, just saw on their online menu that they have a beer terrine salad, don't know how I overlooked that last night, but I'm kicking myself. Any place that has beets on the menu gets an automatic A++.",review,2,ymLuQ7z4R_5Gr1lpuA5lqg

My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.

I got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.

So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).

Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.

Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!

Now it's so much more than that.

Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.

My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of ""flare"" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.

Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.

I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. 

The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. 

Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! 

Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!",review,4,vF4B6eFdoDmyV_l7MLHMzw

guys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Not
really my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,
reggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18
and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. 
NOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind of
place.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot more
eye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle its
more of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impress
anyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.
Bathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about the
bathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  
Prices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if your
hard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!",review,2,_0KkuMf1GL-ccyCR-o_Qpw

Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?

Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was ""Leave your inhibitions at the door"", Bandaids follows up with ""... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes.""  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.

So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at ""the talent"".

Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.

I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a ""whusssuuup"" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly ""Hi!"" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.

This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.

But wait.

On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about ""check out THIS fucking thing!"", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like ""Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?""  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, ""Oh.  Its nice.  I like it."" before shitting himself.

I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  

Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.",review,18,-F32Vl8Rk4dwsmk0f2wRIw

If you BYOC (bring yo own company, bitches!) it is awesome. In this case, I was the company for a totally non-trashy, very classy female friend of mine who was in the mood to slum it. She lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while, so after a few hours of daydrinking, we hit the spot. 

Wow.

Stretch marks. Lots of grinding and wandering hands. Tits everywhere... and shit, that's just the male patrons, holmes. I was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then, and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before... so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an RN in an ICU) and that I was her coke dealer, and the guys were jealous that I was hanging with a hot babe whom I didn't have to pay for attention. So I guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place. How could I not give it 5 stars after that?

In reality we had a sociological discussion about the patrons and employees, and discussed a few articles in the latest issue of the New Yorker, which she happened to have in her purse. 

Some of the characters we saw:

Saigon '68 - Old dude who only got dances from the asian girls, reliving the glory days in 'nam.

Hombre - in his sunday finest with cowboy hat and boots, looking very confused. He might have jumped the border last week.

PCC - White haired, super thin, wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the Phoenix Country Club across the street, in shorts, white polo, knee high white socks, and of course velcro sneakers. He looked reminiscent of a corpse.... except when he got several dances from well endowed black women, at which point he really became alive. 

Short Dick Man - He had clearly sprouted some wood, and it wasn't very impressive. 

Vatos - galore.

So - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab. If you wait around long enough, they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials, though I am sure that the ""grey goose"" I ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose. Whatever.

After reading other reviews of this place, I already had a feeling it was going to be good...but the Paradise Market...hmmm... Made me ask myself what my idea of a paradise market would be. ( In case you were wondering, it would include Gael Garcia Bernal, Alejandro Fernandez, Juanes and other latinos guapos pushing shopping carts... shirtless.)

Anyway...focus!...Walking in from the parking lot, I could already hear lively music spilling out of the store. My blood started to sizzle with excitement. Then, right after crossing the threshold, I beheld a thing of dazzling beauty- carts and carts of aromatic and fresh pan dulce. I knew this place and I were just beginning a long and promising relationship. 

My roommate and I wandered around the pan dulce display cases, salivating, pointing, giggling. We opted not to purchase as we have way too many holiday sweets left over as it is. We continued on to the jugeria where I had the best horchata I have had in a long, long time. Too much of the time horchata is watery. The Ranch Market horchata was so flavorful and creamy. I drank it just like a little kid who doesn't even let the straw leave their mouth for a moment. 

We then wandered throughout the whole store. I know I probably looked awe-struck because it is overwhelming. It is bustling and frenetic and packed full of food treats, smells, conversation...LIFE. Be sure to pass by the tortilleria and take in the smell of freshly cooked tortillas. Also, don't miss the meats! Chicken feet! Tongue!  Tripas! Oh yeah! AWESOME! 

Who the hell would ever want to go to a Safeway again when shopping can be this entertaining?

I'll be sure to go back soon for some pan dulce, a raspado or some lunch. More than anything, I'll go back for the experience because that's what this place is- a cultural experience.",review,2,e9T0tyMXRPDBIHE5BE35UA

This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.

Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!

The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. 

And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.

Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice.",review,7,4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA

Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.

After having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.

Part grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.

But that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.

The place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)

Oh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.

I'm not familiar with the holiday, but it's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them..? Someone help me here. Back to the point, it was EXTREMELY festive, and I don't know if it was the heat, or that I was tired, or that the place was just so decked out in colors and people and decorations, but I got sick. Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again. 

Second time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...? 

Found out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever! 

And the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p.

You can order food-to-go straight from the market, I recommend the shrimp ceviche.  Next stop the meat market - Wow!  Some interesting food you would not find at your local Albertson's.  Carne Asada (marinated) is an excellent and cheap choice to take home and have a mexican bbq in your very own backyard.  

The restaurant next door is also very good - great seafood enchiladas.  There are also soom little shops with items you would expect to find at a border town shop.",review,1,MmPOU8kbuwkE4NedXe-qZw

Clean, fun, great music, and a lot of people watching entertainment.   Personally I don't know what most the stuff is inside here but the smells and quality speak for its self.

I usually make sure I go on Wednesdays where produce is ridiculously cheap...like 7 kiwi's for a dollar or 9lbs for a dollar watermelon...I'm not gonna lie, I have posted my receipts on the fridge with pride...these are my ""A"" graded school papers of adulthood. The only issue is that when I come home with a trunk full of fresh fruit and veggies that cost me $8 I slowly realize I have to actually store and eventually eat all of the produce I just bought. I hear Thursdays are the days to buy meat for cheap--but my fridge is usually busting with pineapple and strawberries by that point and there isn't room for an ounce of carne asada. 
long story short, be prepared to weave through the masses on Wednesday mornings for some great finds. The rest of the market is fabulous as well. The ""Tradiciones"" restaurant serves excellent--and cheap (shocker) authentic Mexican food.

Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!

After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce. 

The meat department is a carnivore's dream come true. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes.

Best Horchata in Phoenix (you have to get it early though because they keep it cold with ice so by late in the day it is slightly watered down and the ideal heterogeneous concentration is lost). The food court inside is amazing. I have been there more times than you and have never had a problem with any of the food or staff. Sometimes communication can be difficult when ordering but if you know exactly what you want (like me) or unless you are fluent in Spanish (which I am not) there should be no problem, so no lallygagging around and no special orders. 

The constant excitement added with a little bit of the English vs. Spanish war gives you the warmth and feel of a truly authentic Phoenix super market food court (I am sure there is some special name for it in the Hispanic culture, or at least something that sounds cooler than food court). I am fortunate that within my lifetime to have lived within a 5 minute drive of the Ranch Market, and I miss it dearly.

I know there are a lot of grocery stores called ""Ranch Market"" throughout the Valley, but when you live anywhere near this one it is the ONLY Ranch Market you will acknowledge.

The owner of Halo turned me on to this place a couple of weeks ago and I finally made my trip over. It's not your typical shopping experience, so if you are faint hearted, don't even attempt it during the warmer months!

This place wholesales to pet stores and service providers, but as they are a locally owned and family run establishment, they open up their warehouse to the general public. Basically, you get to go rummage around their warehouse, along with their workers who are pulling huge orders, and fill up your basket or cart with anything you can imagine that is pet related (except for food). I mean good lord, I didn't even know they made facial scrub products for dogs and had no clue that they had specialty shampoos for red heads, blondes, and brunettes!!!

But let's take a tour of my cart:
tennis ball squeaky bone - check
chicken jerky  - check
chicken rice balls - check
odor eliminator candles - check
happy bunny buffs - check (oh yeah these rock)
window kitty bed - check
case of greenie things - check
remote controlled citronella training collar - check
horribly embarrassing foo foo collar decoration - check

Here are few things you should know before you go:
1) There is a $25 minimum purchase (not sure if that is the same on line).
2) Every single one of their products is on their website or in their catalog and that is where you will find pricing info.
3) They have tiered pricing, so if you are buying one of an item, you will pay the highest amount. Each item has a ""bulk"" price which kicks in when you buy 3 to 12 of that item (depending on the product).
4) Prices ROCK, even the highest price is about 20% less than the big box pet stores and as much as 50% less than the boutiques. I went to look for a spray training collar (the non-shock kind) for my youngest dog and it was literally 60% less than the best price I could find anywhere else.
5) You have to put it together... if you are buying a crate or carrier, they will get it to your car, but  you have to assemble it yourself.
6) They have two full walls covered with clearance items that you will never see on line or in a catalogue.
7) This place is only open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but phone and web orders can be picked up until 5:00 p.m.
8) The warehouse is cooled by coolers and was hotter than a son of a bitch when I was there. Industrial fans be damned... nothing is going to make you cooler - but a deal is a deal. Go in the cooler months and stock up, or shop on line.  http://www.ryanspet.com/ryanspet/default.asp?

The staff is INCREDIBLY nice (especially considering that they must be rattled by the heat during the summer). As you are wandering the aisles, they make sure you know they are there to answer questions, pull box, help you find a specific item, etc.

They also have a sharpening service in their sister building, where you can get your shears spiffed up for a reasonable price.

Horse Dog goes though dog beds about every month or so, and he requires state-of-the-art industrial toys, as he can destroy anything (including tires, couch cushions or shoes) in a matter of seconds. 

Just when I thought that Horse Dog was also going to consume my wallet as a result of his high-priced needs, I drove by Ryan's Pet Supplies and decided to stop in. Wholesale? Pet Supplies? In a world of overpriced PETCOs and PetSmarts, this place is now my savior.

Since their warehouse is Home Depot sized, things were a little bit hard to find at first. I was overwhelmed by aisle after aisle of boxes stacked on shelves towering to the celling. Luckily the staff members here are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and accessible. They were more than happy to guide me through the store, answer my questions and open / search through box after box until I found exactly what I wanted. 

Ultimately I decided to purchase a massive human femur sized dog bone for only $9, and a giant industrial rope knot for a mere $8. My jaw dropped when the casher rang me up for a whopping grand total of $17. I would have spent well over $50 had I purchased these two items elsewhere.  

And it gets even better. Ryan's also has a catalog, so I can call ahead and phone in my order. It's like take-out for dog supplies. Plus if they don't have what your looking for, they can get it for you within a weeks time so you don't have to waste a trip there. 

Also, as a note to the ladies (or men too if you've got your murse in tow), they don't allow purses or bags of any kind into the warehouse. I didn't know this the first time I walked in, so they flagged me down upon my entrance. They lock your purses up in little cages, or they say you can leave it in your car...but um hello...have you seen that area?! So it's perfectly safe under the watchful eye of the cashiers. And if you seriously think that these employees are going to steal something from your purse, that they lock in a cage, in area equipped with video cameras, then you are overly paranoid.

The store is centrally located on McDowell Road, and while the area is not exactly DC Ranch, you are not in the ghetto, and you will be perfectly safe even if you don't own an AR-15.

It is really important to note that Ryan's is set up as an internet order place, NOT as a retail store. This explains why the business does a few things differently than regular retail. Purses/bags either need to be left in your car, or the store will lock them up in the front. I recommend you bring your purse/bag inside, the staff is cool, and they will lock it up for you. While this may be an inconvenience , the price difference will easily make up for any hiccups.

The second tip that will save you time/energy is to know what you wish to purchase, and know how much it will cost. As mentioned before, it is a warehouse, and items are not labeled with price, it's a huge warehouse setup. They have catalogs all over the place to check prices, but my recommendation is to bring your catalog with pages marked of the stuff you want. The staff is super friendly, and will help you with where things are at. It's not always easy to know who works there, but you will figure it out, they're usually pushing metal carts, basically fulfilling online orders by pulling merchandise from the bins.

While you're here, you will find toys, brushes, shampoos, snacks, you name it! The prices are very very good, and you will be happily surprised at the difference between the other guys and Ryan's. Don't miss the kong squeaky toy line, they have fun squeaky toys that are hard to break. Also, the fleecy rope toys are great for dogs teeth, and keep them fresh and so clean clean. Avoid any rope toys, they can break down and when dogs eat them, they can do big time damage to stomach, GI etc.

Happy shopping, and lastly you CAN bring in your dog and have a helper while you shop.",review,5,AYGHNy8gPxl2Q-etTT3hZw

helpful hints:
*all bags and purses must remain outside the warehouse. Staff will secure your bags for you.

You can't beat the prices; they are approximately half of what you'd pay at other pet stores.  I am a volunteer puppy raiser, and the pups I raise can only have Kong or Nylabone toys when alone in their crate.  I would go broke buying those anywhere else.  

The staff at Ryan's is really in the warehouse to fill internet orders, but I've always gotten any help I needed from them.  They have all been friendly to me, and I've often been asked if I needed help finding anything.

When you visit, pick up a catalog at the front desk, and leave your purse if you have one.  (You can't bring bags to the back.)  Many of the items on the shelves have prices written on the cartons, but some don't.  And, remember, this is a warehouse...the employees are filling internet orders.  They are not there to tell you prices.  But, trust me, you won't find lower prices anywhere except maybe a yard sale or second hand store.

If you live in AZ but not close to Ryan's, a handy thing to know is that you can order on their website an select ""pick up"".  Then, your order is already pulled for you when you arrive, and you just need to pay for it.

Of course, you can always order online and have it shipped to you.

You can really tell that they take their time and use a critical eye with what pieces they choose to restore and sell. I have no problem with sounding pretentious here, but the furniture they have in stock truly are pieces of design art. If you can afford what they have to offer, buy it. If not, feel free to peruse around the store as though it were a museum. I used to live in LA and there were places like this in Silverlake, Melrose, etc., but none of them had the selection or quality that this store did.

The owner here is really cool and encourages you to look around even if they know that you probably can't afford anything there (like they did with me).

I used to complain about this until I became aware of what the going prices are for the same exact items in coastal cities. Phoenix: we got it good; stop complaining.

We recently showed our home for the first time on a historic home tour. A Tudor Revival built in 1931, we've always struggled to find the right furniture, accents and fixtures to fit the antique style with our modern tastes. We went to Red hoping just to find some inspiration, but after explaining to the owner what we were doing, he offered to send someone to review our space.

We ended up with a suede 60's era danish couch and two leather chairs that made the rest of our interior look downright stupid. We ended up redecorating, paint and all, to better suit the new furniture. It was a lot of work but well worth it.

We now are on the verge of a full-blown vintage furniture addiction that is only being held back by our income. I've actually considered putting off plans to travel the world and raise a family in order to get the perfect coffee table.",review,0,0zC-ws9bQNv5zjTSXYu-NA

I was being seen every 2 weeks for 7 months and have found the office staff courteous, the ultrasonographers top notch (they knew the sex of the twins at week 12!) and the physicians knowledgeable and warm.  It is true that the wait times can be long especially in the afternoon but this is a fact of life in a high risk practice where many of the patients are very complicated.  To minimize this issue i would ask for the first available morning appointments if you can work this into your schedule.  To me, modifying my schedule seemed insignificant compared with the outstanding care i and my twins were receiving.  

A primary issue id like to address is the continuity of care.  This is a large practice with 10+ doctors and it is true that at time the doctor was not overly familiar with my case since the doctors do rotate among 3 valley locations.  We had no significant complications so this was not that big of an issue for us but i can see how that would be difficult for someone who had a serious ongoing medical complication and/or did not feel comfortable with the details of their own medical care.  PPA is a very large group practice with many moving parts and lack of continuity is a major weakness of large group practices as a model.  If you are not comfortable with this type of model dont go to PPA.  There are other, smaller, MFM practices out there that can give you the personal touch you desire.   I work in the medical field and felt comfortable relaying the details of my case to the physician i was seeing.  They do have your chart with them they just may not have reviewed it in detail before the appointment.  Any time i did have a question either generally speaking with multiple gestation or specific to my case they were able to answer the questions to my satisfaction.

Other perks of this practice is that at Banner Good Sam and at Scottsdale Shea (i think) they have 24 hour in house coverage. I landed in OB Triage at Good Sam at 32 weeks with concern for preterm labor and the PPA physician on call came and spoke to me personally and relayed the information to the office for my office visit the next day.  I was impressed and relieved by this type of physician coverage. When i give birth in the next few weeks it will be nice to know that there is already a doctor on call on the premises.

In short, PPA is an excellent choice for high risk pregnancy care if you are wiling to modify your schedule to show up in the morning to avoid wait times and if you are okay with some lack of continuity of care that in my opinion does not affect the quality of care which is outstanding.",review,0,8htMWt7OikU-3rAYK9bhkQ

If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.

Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. 

For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. 

The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.

I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too.

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties.

Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it.

What great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you'll find them the hard way, BTW, but that's another story).
As I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was ""what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won't kill me where I stand?""
Not an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted's or Long Wong's?; an Italian Beef  from Luke's; Chicken and waffles from Lolo's?
And then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco's de Juarez!!!!!
As anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a ""Trendinista"" of the first order. 
I follow the herd, make no mistake about it! 
Why?
Because, occasionally, the herd knows where it's going...and this is one of those very special occasions!
I had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger.
But since I wasn't packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here. 
Yelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn't a Betos or Bertos in sight. 
Worth a try, right?
Taco's of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat's ass. 
I sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino's) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I've had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad).
In an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita (""gordita"" means ""meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried"" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW).
Freakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.
I awoke to shouts of ""clear"" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! 
I am fine:) !!
So, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town!
And now, another one on my list of favorite places to retox after I've detoxed!",review,11,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g

Since this was my first time I thought I would try the basic Mexican food combo to judge the place.  I had the #17 Taco and Enchilada rice and beans I added beef to the enchilada. (comes shredded unless you specify ground) I can't say one bad thing about the dish. It was amazing. The rice was perfect for my taste and even the beans were good.  I really enjoyed the salsa.

I was downtown so I decided to check it out with my sister.... I ordered the #5 carne asada soft tacos off the lunch menu and a large horchata ($5.99 and $1.99) and my sister order just one chicken soft taco............probably because I brought her to a place she's never been before, plus there were a few guys outside working on a vehicle and it sat in an open lot between two odd buildings... haha. So we got our food within 8 mins, not bad at all... she opened her bag and took one bite then scarffed the rest.

I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese!

beautiful historic home turned upscale-casual restaurant, in the style of Coup de Tartes or House of Tricks. It was relatively busy, but we were sat right away.

Mom had the BBQ chicken, BF had pork tenderloin (I'm not a pork fan usually, but this was melt in your mouth delicious and not overly salty at all) and i had the meatloaf entree (not sandwich, as advised by the young and very pleasant server).

we were all very pleased with our orders and service was prompt, professional and pleasant. the woman dining next to us came as a recommendation while in town from the owner and chef's cousin. she asked the server to let him know she was here so she could meet him and say hi, and after the crowd died down a bit, he did and seemed like super cool, down to earth guy.

i overheard him mention his ""other restaurant"" so on our way out i asked him about it. he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about). i will be heading there on my next dining adventure.

dinner entrees were priced between $15 to $25, cheapest glass of wine was $6 (not bad, the food was couturely presented and tasty).

What can be better than brunch/lunch in a quaint historic home adorned with kitschy antiques? Nothing! The answer is nothing.

We went here for a late lunch one Saturday, and it hit the spot. It was perfect. We all fell in love with the adorable house and its wooden floors, unique furniture and abundance of natural daylight. Our server was quite friendly and pleasant, and she let us take our time while also suggesting menu options.

We started with 3 sticky buns - a little rich for me, but very indulgent and sinful. Yum. My husband then moved on to a cheeseburger, which was very tasty. My friend ordered the turkey sandwich, which was bigger than big. I ordered a cup of soup and a half chicken salad sandwich. All of it was very satisfying and super filling. Of course, we couldn't pass on dessert, so we tried the bread pudding. Simply fabulous.

My first encounter a few months ago was on a whim. I was slightly hungry and just wanted something quick and healthy before I headed off to do my next massage. Well hello Coronado Cafe. I had been wanting to try this place but just kept passing it by. It is late afternoon and I walk up to the door and it is locked. Ohh well I thought I guess they close after lunch then reopen for dinner. I start to walk away and someone opens the door. The guy explains that they are indeed closed until dinner and would open in about 30 mins or so. Well I could not wait that long or I would be late for my next appointment. He says come on in anyway. What customer service! I just had a quick salad and it was wonderful. I really appreciated the guy doing that for me. 

HINT TO RESTAURANT OWNERS: Customer service is key. 

So I went back a few days later for brunch and had the friendliest waiter...Dan. He is great. I go in pretty regularly on Saturdays for brunch and for a great meal and a little chatting with Dan.

OK back to the food. My brunch consisted of the Crab Eggs Benedict, with a side of roasted potatoes and fruit salad. This is one of my FAVORITE meals ever. They get it right with the texture (big thing for me) and the flavors. They use foccacia bread instead of English muffins. The crab is lump crab meat with a few slices of avocado on top. The hollandaise sauce is creamy and light. Not too heavy. Sometimes this sauce can be made that weighs the dish down. Now I am personally taking a chance on eating eggs over easy but it is so good. I try to be aware of it but sometimes the eggs win and my tummy pays for it later :(

The Farm Salad is awesome. Salty, tangy goat cheese warm and gooey coated with nuts. The strawberries add a little sweetness. YUM YUM

The Portebello sandwich is another favorite. So you vegetarians won't be disappointed here. 

I will say they charge $3 for iced tea. Now that is a bit much especially when you are using crappy Lipton tea. I am a tea lover and don't mind spending that kind of money on tea but it better be fresh tea leaves that I can get a few presses out of.

It is a small place so you will be in close proximity to other patrons. However, I have ended up in a few nice conversations with some very nice individuals. I sometimes come early for brunch and have a whole room to myself to eat, read and chat with my waiter extraordinaire Dan.

Lunch is usually packed here and the wait can be long so keep that in mind and try to go when you can have an executive lunch.

All in all I love CC. It is becoming the equivalent of my neighborhood diner. (All you NY'ers know what I am talking about) The place where you come in and everyone knows you and you have great meal with some great company. I never thought I could have the neighborhood diner experience here in AZ. But Coronado Cafe does just that.",review,1,ZIF9MST0WFyxB5arAKD2NA

We were meandering down 7th St. trying to decide where we should eat. When the Coronado Cafe sign was with in sight, it truly was ""SIGN"" to eat there.

What a great place to have a meal!  Everyone mentioned how intimate and cozy the inside of this restaurant was and they were correct.  The wait staff was also perfectly attentive.

We ordered a margarita and sangria.  Jeannie loved her sangria and my margarita (just the plain house version) was very tasty.  

We agreed that we wanted to share a few small dishes.  The crab cakes and scallops proved to be a super tasty start.  We highly recommend both!

Each of us ordered a Greek salad.  It was a little too tart for me, but Jeannie enjoyed hers and helped me with mine.

Finished off our shared meal with the special of the day.  It was halibut with a parsnip puree and steamed veggies.  The fish tasted very fresh and the parsnip puree was enjoyed more by me than the lovely wife.  

Everything we ordered was a reflection of the cafe itself...delicately seasoned, prepared, and presented. Getting to enjoy carefully prepared food and drinks while in a perfectly simple setting was time well spent.

Coronado Cafe came up as one of the highest ranked in the area and they did not disappoint.

Located within a 1920's built house this charming cafe served up some of the best lunch time fare that I've had in sometime. Not only that but they have wonderful Bloody Marys that were only $3. I went with a half sandwich and side salad. My sandwich was the Pest Chicken and it was delicious as was the salad. My business partner is from Baltimore and when he heard the waiter state that they have the best crab cakes in town he naturally ordered them. He, being an expert on crab, was immediately transported back home with his first bite.

Table cloths and faux candles
Menu full of artfully presented items
Wines by the glass or bottle
Background music in lieu of background noise.

We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?

For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.

The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.

Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12

I had the pesto chicken sandwich. Relatively gigantic for the price ($11) given the quality of the ingredients. I was impressed. The focaccia bread was fresh. Chicken breast perfectly cooked.

I spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:

-------------------------------------------------------------
-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the ""promotion"" the representative offered me.

-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!

- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!

- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  ""Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the ""Back Button"" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.""  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!

-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered ""downgrading"" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!

-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!

- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.

Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. 
After that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?
Finally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind.

We started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.

Then came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.

My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.

Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  

Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?

It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, ""It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it."". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop.

The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. 

Today is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their ""new policy"" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, ""That's exactly how we feel."" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.

I will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special.

However, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. 

I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. 

Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.

I thought the heavy curtains that frame the sheer might help to reduce the mind numbing highway noise.  But guess what, they're decorative only and can't be closed.
I spent $65/night through Price Line, and that was about $50 too much.
A few annoyances, in addition to the brain gelatinizing cacophony:

1) What the hell is with the 30 lbs. down duvets that these hotels seem to think add a half star to their rating?  They're excessively hot on all but the coldest nights, they weigh a freaking ton, and when they end up on the floor (as is always my deal) you have nothing left but the thread bare, pallid, dirty sheet. Which isn't enough.

2) Setting the alarm clock requires an advanced degree in electrical engineering.  Seriously, you really expect people to use these pieces of junk? Which leads me to annoyance number 3:

3) When I tried to use the dirty, circa 1981 phone to set my wake up call, and I successively pressed all four of the ""At your service"" buttons I got nothing.  I messed around with the phone for 15 minutes before I finally reached a guy working in the bar (I could never hope to duplicate this feat).  He was kind enough to transfer me to the front desk.

4) I was going to use the in-room coffee maker but it had been filled, at some point, with sour smelling water.  On my worst day of caffiene deprivation, I wouldn't have used that disgusting and antiquated little machine.

A flat screen TV and a weighty down (or down substitute, as it where) duvet do not make a 3.5 star hotel! This place needs a major capital infusion.  Thank you for your time.",review,1,M_Z-4EpQ47V7NrNx-sLCdA

Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.

CASH OR CHECK ONLY

Worth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  

They were out of the fried chicken ""dinner"" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. 

The decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.

The service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50.

The ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. They aren't. The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco. The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette.

Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.

Tangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.

After a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.

A receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.

On the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.

I wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.",review,0,M5WHq55eaXZEfVIsEqBAsA

I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.

After the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.
20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said ""oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.""
5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.""
5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.

They were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.

Finally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:
Fish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.
Fries: Were best part of the meal.
Tartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.
Coleslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.

Ordered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.

We were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.
He came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.

Finishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.

Maybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.

The best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.

We  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.

30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.

girlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this.",review,4,k757Jx5Sa3dfqGAOSqJLpA

Whenever possible, I purchase parts and services from local dealerships.  Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  

That said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.

I called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (""PD"" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.

So imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use ""any old oil"" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.

I then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.

So, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).",review,5,oFhtzLhXS1iENWoBMdWk4w

I ordered a Gyro sandwich.  It came with fries and a bowl of soup.  I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup.  I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe.

I wish the rest of the meal was that good.  When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  

Sarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.

the burger with BBQ, Bacon, and onions, with seasoned fries and a side salad with croutons....  The salad came back without croutons, had to hunt the waitress down to get them..  The Fries came back without any seasoning. and the fries tasted just awful!  The Burger wasnt too bad.. Although, I think i would have rather have eaten a Bic Mac lol.

The CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders. And they wait. And wait. And wait. Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off.

The CARS pull up closer. And they wait. And wait. And wait.

A few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant. They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant. Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant.

The CARS continue to wait. Minutes more pass.

Two more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food.

The DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, ""This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here.  Mickey D's is right over there.... Wait... Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!""

BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving. The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot.

The CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off. The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER.

BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): ""How long have these nice people been waiting?! 

CASHIER (searching for the order ticket): ""Um... 15 minutes.""

BK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): ""Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!""

SOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): ""It's okay, we just want the food we ordered.... And, besides, there are three of us. Not two.""

BK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): ""Just get them some ice cream... they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow. Lucky I stopped them. You're the manager. Manage!""

A few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way.

SOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: ""Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!? 

SOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it?

SOUL PASSENGER #1: ""It's cold. And I mean cold. It doesn't taste like meat. It's just rubbery and tasteless... and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--?

SOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: ""And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun's stale, too!""

SOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: ""that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!""

SOUL PASSENGER #1: ""Or 'Punked.""

SOUL PASSENGER #2: ""We were punked, all right. Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's... the food is always hot and delicious there. And the staff is nice and helpful, too.

The GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can. 

SOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: ""Never again.""

SOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: ""Never again!""

When I go to a place called Cheeseburger in Paradise I expect something above and beyond the regular burger down the street.  Instead, all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names.   Every burger I have ever ordered here has been lesser than any burger at any  greasy spoon or family restaurant.   
I was hoping they would have some steak fries instead of the usual basic fries.  Nope.   The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name.   What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef.  Probably some person that said, ""good enough, let's go make some money"".
Our burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  
I would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.

Last night (Thursday) we arrived at 10:20 pm for a late dinner after a show. Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  

The only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! 

Our food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! 

My partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. 

I will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book. Also, why close the bar 30 minutes early????

server was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place.

we ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over.  while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold.  it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice.

mid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived.  i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it.. so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite.

however, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either.
i got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three.  the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish.

my beau's steak was inedible.  his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out.  he only managed to gnaw through half the steak .. and i think he did that only because he was so hungry.  he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more.

I decided to try on some dresses & skirts. I went into a dressing room to change. I went to the room furthest from the dressing entry way. While changing my clothes I heard a mans voice.

I frantically search for a way to lock the door, but there is not lock! The door flies open! There is a man standing there looking me up & down, smiling at me! I was trying on dresses so I was completely undressed. I went into shock, screaming you can be in here!!

I came out of the dressing room yelling ""there is a man in the dressing room""!

The clerks told him he shouldn't be in there, but weren't that concerned about what just happened to me! The only person who seem to care was a customer, she appeared to be shocked about the situation I left the store in tears.

The next day I called the manager. She didn't think it was a big deal! I said ""why don't you have locks on the dressing room doors? You could have prevented this horrible situation!"" She had no response to my question. She said she would send me a $50.00 gift card, but I received no apology, how insulting!

Come to find out not a single dressing room in Boston Store East Town, not even lingerie dept has a lock on the door. I believe this is every woman's worst nightmare!

Aren't we supposed to feel safe in a store while in a state of undress? I wish it had not happened to me, but it did. I would like to bring awareness to other women. I will always make sure the dressing room has a lock before I enter and undress.

I spoke with store manager several times. I let her know I spend thousand of dollars every year at Boston Store. She didn't seem to care. I asked to speak with upper management, she will not give phone number I gave her mine. To date no one has called.

I feel I was stalked at Boston Store that day. He may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room. I feel lucky I was no raped!

My husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's. Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years. The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game...

Tonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.

The kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.

We asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound!

One would think that any restaurant in America's Dairyland, especially a chain restaurant that has been around for decades, could serve breakfast without screwing it up.

Our family of three ordered breakfast for dinner tonight and this Perkins disappointed the heck out of us.

One order was steak and eggs: the steak was supposed to be medium and the eggs over hard. What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak -- not rare, mind you, but raw -- and eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge.

Some of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, which was scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy. One does not expect the possibility of breaking a tooth when eating scrambled eggs, but not one, not two, but three two-inch long pieces of that translucent crust ended up in the folded, dry ""scrambled eggs.""

Another order of scrambled eggs -- mine -- had a long, thin, hair-like thread of indeterminate origin. Was it the same substance as the translucent crust? Was it a string from a hairnet? Was it a human hair? When I pulled it from my mouth, it split in two and curled up like elastic might curl up.

Our server was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things okay -- the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrid!

The manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, so we told her. She took 20% off of our bill but, truly, the food we ate was overpriced at any discount. If we all hadn't been so darn hungry and tired, we'd have left without eating. And if I had it to do over, I would have insisted we all leave after finding the inedible translucent hard gluey stuff in the eggs and find somewhere else to go.

Do NOT repeat our mistake. AVOID this restaurant. Try the IHOP down the road if you want breakfast. Go across the interstate to Texas Roadhouse if you want a steak. Go hungry if you must, just don't eat here. Please.",review,0,Wv6obm4AWIHBNd4ejaXVLA

I tried one more time to sell some novels and after the clerk gave me a pay slip he threw my book in the garbage right in front of me.

I have been in the state for 4 months and this is the WORST restaurant choice we have made so far. I had a bad feeling and should have listened to my instinct. Wasted $40.

Let me start by saying the host/hostess were the nicest staff at the place. 

My husband ordered the 7 oz sirloin with riblets, seasonal vegatables and mashed potatoes. The sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery. There was no meat to be eaten. It was just a hunk of fat. The riblets even had a weird smoke flavor that he compared to cigarette smoke. We do not go places looking for an all smiles server, but this guy did not smile and when he saw we were not enjoying our meal and my husband's plate was still full, he did not even ask if the food was okay or if there was something he could do. We don't like to complain and just were not in the mood to even let him or the manager know. I really did not expect the food to be so bad. I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip. For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed. The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi. Sad. We will not be returning. For such a nice ""looking"" exterior, you would think they'd have more quality food and servers. I guess you get what you pay for..sadly.

It's a greenhouse.

I get it. 
But their structure is so small and plants are packed together so closely, that it's really difficult to roam around with a cart and peruse their selection. I felt hot and uncomfortable the entire time, bumping into plants, bumping into other shoppers...

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. 

There've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. 

Then there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. 

Deli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. 

Deli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker ""clean"" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. 

Deli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. 

You can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a ""freegan"" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small ""mom & pop"" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems.",review,1,4bsu8DLfDkBV84RKn6UmcA

The day of our appointment we showed up and they started our hands first...they seated us away from each other when they knew we had come in together. So that bothered me right off the bat.

Coconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   

Lamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.

Rice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  

I tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.

To start, we could see that the staff had changed.  The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff.  The server did not understand English well enough to properly place the order, so there was extra wine for one person.  Also, the glassware and flatware were spotted, with some that needed to be sent back.

The service had really changed for the worse.  The server would clear one dirty plate, then wander off, return five minutes later to get another and so on.  The Manager or owner really needs to train the staff.  They were all working, but seemed unclear as to who was responsible for what duties.

We also ordered ice cream and a special birthday dessert, while very tasty - the service was vey slow, at least 10 minutes from the time the ice cream was ordered to served.

My first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing. The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. 

My second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there. This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside. The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense. The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. 

Free music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:
- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination
- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP
- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck

I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. 

I won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting.

At first I thought it was just sarcastic ""Soup Nazi"" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.

Also, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  

The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.

In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.

Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.

So I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The ""sugar-fried"" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.

I strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.

The Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.

I arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. 

The employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.

When I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could ""saw"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.

Because of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.

Even more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. 

Returning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was ""f-ing out of here"" because he had ""the longest f-ing day of his life"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation.

My mother and I went this past weekend very hopeful that the food would be good based on the fact they won Best in Madison. How on earth did this place win any award for great food and service is beyond me.


The menu was extremely old, small and the coffee was pure water.  
I order the walleye, hash browns, toast and eggs breakfast.
My mother order biscuits and gravy

My toast was cold, hash browns had no tastes, over easy eggs were not cooked fully and fish was very small in size.

Mothers gravy was too salty and a thick bunch of sop. 

The menu had no coordination. Biscuit,gravy and hash browns? That is nothing but starch!

With that aside,
Not only that but the server was horrible. I felt like she ignored my mother and I the entire time. I understand they were kinda busy. Fine. We can be patient. However, she refilled coffees at her other tables and stopped by to tell the customers their food was being made after waiting for so long. We did not receive such treatment. She passed our table several times and never once asked us how was the food or why our orders were taking so long. Not once.  She was a horrible waitress.

Neither my mother or I could finish our food. I took possibly 4 bites and was done.
We spent less time eating then we did waiting and ordering. Waitress continued to ignore us, so we got up and just walked over to pay.

I told the cashier the food was horrible and I wouldn't be back. She then stated to us that normally the food is good and she wasn't sure why it was taking the kitchen so long and were getting orders wrong.

 But here is the killer... she then leans over and says "" I hate our kitchen staff, we need new ones""

What kind of place does that? You do no throw your co workers under the bus TO CUSTOMERS! I was beyond flabbergasted. 

Just a horrible business, not friendly and food is beyond pathetic. 
Do not go here. I have no idea who in their right mind would vote them as ""Best in Madison"" or give it 5 stars unless you do not have taste buds.

I needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike. I had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value. Very simple issue....

I walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed. Another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me. 

The first lady bike was serviced. I was clearly next. The guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me! It was clear that I was next, but he didn't serve me. 

I patiently waiting thinking something was strange. He then asked me what I needed. I explained and we walked to the pump. He started to pump the air into the value, stopped 1/2 way through, and went to help the white gentleman. He just left me standing there. ??????

He got a set of tires for the man and left me wondering what I had done. I walked back in the shop wondering what was going on. I stood next to the gentleman. As the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store, the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working. He thanked me for my patience and went along. 

Again, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh? 

I said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire?'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, ""you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it"". Wow!!!!!

...and he walked back in the store, leaving me by myself. 

I'm serious, I stood there shocked and wondering what was happening.

I am an African American professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first Monona-lake bike ride. I didn't deserve service like this.

We examined the pictures and cabinet door at length, cross-referencing them against the Merillat parts catalog, until we both agreed that we had a positive match. I should mention that Julie took notes furiously throughout the process, carefully noting the product number for each item (or so I thought). Since a phone call to Merillat HQ was required to price out the order and the don't do business on weekends, she promised a follow-up call on Monday with final price information.

I got said call on Monday with final pricing. All that was left was for me to sign a contract (Julie's language, not mine) and put 50% down.

The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.

It is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.

Back to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!

There was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.

Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term ""buttercream"" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.

I see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.

Then came yesterday:

I have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  

So I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  

I continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  

Now, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  

That is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.  I will NOT go to your store.",review,3,RvweNJFVkR3ttkWsIBy7nQ

I booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really, how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out.) Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF? You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?

I swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?

Honestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.

I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel 6 in Custer, South Dakota (no lie!).  I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.

The gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  

The biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin' Pillsbury, out-of-the-can, cook 'em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, I'll stay home and cook it myself.

On the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.

Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.

Our entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.

The fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, ""No, I already got this half full bowl.""

A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.

The food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.

From the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were ""going to need a high chair for that?"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.

We were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.

She knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.

In this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.

Another server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.

We go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.

At no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.

I'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.

I guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.",review,0,I7n_-Xq5N8KKvu69sZS-hA

Now, I am an average consumer with a college education, however, I am not familiar with HVAC systems at all. So, I am posting this in the public to hopefully help other consumers to not fall for the ""Spring Tune Up"" Offer by All Comfort Services @ 5245 Voges Road Madison, WI 53718. 

In full transparency I am also posting copies of the quotes & receipts from the technician. Here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111026625881803880071/posts/PKBhrxTNQs7 

Scenario: 
- I found a special on Angieslist for $139 for a technician to come to my house for a spring AC Tune Up. 
- My system is 23 years old, and the furnace has been very well maintained works fine. 
- The technician was at my house for 45 minutes. 

1. Replaced my furnace filter. 
2. Put ""Comfort Services"" stickers all over my furnace (and removed the competitors) 
3. I showed him how to turn on my thermostat (I have a nest) 
4. Hooked up the gauges to the AC and ran the system 6. Stated that I have a very small amount of freon, and that it is cost prohibitive to find a leak ($435-$600, and recharge $161). 
5. Recommended that I buy a new AC unit and furnace 
6. Charged me $139. 
7. Scheduled a Salesman to come to my house 2 business days later to sell me a new A/C & Furnace system for between $7,679 - $8,742. 


Since then, I have had 2 other HVAC companies visit me and make other recommendations and provide a complimentary ""leak check"" by loading in nitrogen and offering me some other options. 


Conclusion: I've decided to recharge the freon in my system through another HVAC company and they will come out in 2 months (free of charge) to test my pressure again. My honest opinion is that All Comfort Services uses their technicians to generate leads to replace full HVAC systems.

We visited here several times in search of our next doggie family member. Never were we greeted. Not even a mean greeting, or a rude greeting... No greeting. It seems anyone can just walk in here and roam around. That was always a red flag to me when I went there but we wanted to rescue a dog and give it a loving home, so we continued to go.

Finally, we found a dog that didn't have ""adoption pending"" on it's kennel, since almost all do there ( maybe try keeping animals who are already adopted separate from available ones,DCHS?). We had to track down a staff member since none ever seem to be around even monitoring the dog kennels (another red flag). Finally we did and we asked to see the dog. Here's where it really got weird...

The two women, who never introduced themselves (I refer to them as the blonde and the brunette) seemed very adamant about us taking him that same evening. They hadn't asked us any interview questions like other shelters do... They never even asked us what type of home he'd be in or anything. they asked us if we had kids, if we lived alone, and if we owned our home. Apparently three questions answered and you can take home a dog? ( horrible). But we were so excited about the dog we weren't really thinking about their lack of questions or how pushy they seemed about us taking him right away.

Once we got home with him we learned why they were so pushy. They told us he was so sweet... Such a calm guy, loving etc. They said he got nervous in the kennel but that's it. We bring him home and within a few hours he is biting us, growling at us, and literally grabbed my subway sand which out of my hand the second I picked it up .. When I tried to say no and get my sandwich back he bit my hand and drew blood. Later he also stole the remote out of my boyfriends hand and tore it to pieces in a second. He growls everytime you go near him.. And this is while we are talking in calm quiet voices, moving slowly, trying to do anything to make him feel calmer.

He has now bitten us each multiple times in 12 hrs.. He knocks anything over (plants, anything on the counter) and growls at you and tries to bite if you run to pick it up.

I'm not mad at the dog. It isn't his fault he probably was abused in previous homes. But- it was absolutely the DCHS job to tell us he was aggressive. To tell us he bites and snarls and growls. To tell us he may guard food even food that isn't his. Were furious that they completely lied to us and were so pushy about us taking him immediately (no wonder why though). Do NOT adopt a dog from here simply because these people have no business conducting behavioral assessments on dogs as they failed with this one... They also are illegally lying to people to get them to take home a dog. 

We are furious and wanted this dog more than anything but we deserved to be properly prepared for the way he is so aggressive. We told them we wanted a calm family dog who was a sweetie and we go on runs with. They had him in the shelter for a month- if we learned his behaviors in a day, I'm sure they knew all about his biting and aggression. I've had many dogs all who were trained by me and I have never seen a dog with this level of aggression in my life. I'm severely disappointed in the DCHS.

The floors were littered with papers, trash and crumbs, the tables and chairs were in disarray and looked like they hadn't been washed or wiped all day.  I've seen junior high school cafeterias right after lunch that were more inviting.  

The sandwiches we ordered were OK.  One was supposed to come with dressing, so I asked for it on the side.  A large, overfed bozo yelled from the back they can't give it on the side - either take it on the sandwich or do without.

When the sandwiches arrived, my dining companion's arrived with a cup of the very same dressing I was told was not available.   When I asked for the one that should have come with my order, Big Bozo yelled it was too late - I already accepted it without.  I showed him the one we were just served, and he yelled back that was all we we're going to get.

He then walked up front to where we were seated and told us to get the hell out.  He refused to refund our money but changed his mind after we threatened to call the police if he didn't.

Home Depot sells toilets for s**t like this, and, as far as I'm concerned, ALL Dominos are long overdue for a final flush.

Gee, what a lot of rock and no roll...  

You REALLY think this is an efficient way of appeasing abused customers - making them jump through all kinds of ridiculous, impossible website hoops, ifs, and, buts, exclusions, etc. just for a measly $10 discount off $4 worth of cold pizza?  

I'd be impressed if you reported back to me with the corrective actions you took - and then simply mailed me a coupon of substantive value.

Since this incident we've learned just how low Domino's public image has sunk, and the reasons why.  And this flaccid effort at improving Domino's customer relations is typical of Domino's go-to-hell attitude.

It seemed like a nice place inside - totally empty, but it was late and a weeknight, so I didn't think much of it. I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.

This is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. 

The area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. 
By the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. 
I'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:

I puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.
After he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.
Shortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. 

The point of this whole review is this:
Ladies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.",review,4,lGROEmEZaINjHghhViWdeQ

Friday March 30th I went to see some of my favorite bands perform at this venue. One of them being the well-loved Phoenix band Snake! Snake! Snakes! Drummer David Cooper was physically assaulted by the venue manager Caesar Rodriguez* when he walked into the managers office and asked to borrow a rug that he needed to put under his drum kit. Rodriguez told him no, and said he didn't give a f$#k. Cooper then asked why they had bands play here if they didn't give a f$#k. To which the venue manager responded by dragging Cooper out of his office by his collar, put him in a choke hold, and drug him down the stairs in front of at least 100 witnesses. If you haven't seen Snake! Snake! Snakes!  -- this is a very kind, peaceful, fun indie band, and great people as well. Professionally they are always a pleasure to work with, and they don't even remotely appear menacing. To make this story even more odd - David was having a professional conversation with this same manager just an hour before the altercation. I saw David being drug down the steps, and then I hung out with him for the next couple of hours while waiting for the Phoenix Police.

PS - the sound system was absolutely atrocious, when I told the sound guy there was a problem with the bass amp cutting in and out, it he told me that it was the bands equipment, and it clearly wasn't. The problems started with the first band, and continued through the second band. All of the amps were cutting in and out, there cracks, pops and echos, it appeared to be some sort of electrical current problem.

Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. 

Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment.

First, the good:  This place is sooo clean, the guys are all awesome, polite, knowledgeable and you just get a great sense of being in a respectable place.   

The bad: One the way out the door, the mechanic that checked me in mentioned that it would be ""Fifty bucks to check out the car, and we'll call you with a quote.""

The quote came in for almost $900, which was far more than I was able to pay.   When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. 

I was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.

Bottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.

UPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.

Implying that technicians who charge less than them are somehow lower quality is just bullshit, plain and simple.

They wanted to charge us more than $600 to put on new brake rotors and pads.  Retail for those parts?  About $150.  Hours it takes to swap them out?  One, or two, at the most.

Naturally, when I called them and sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about, they knocked $150 off the price they offered my wife.  Still not good enough.  It was $300 cheaper to tow our car all the way to our trusted Mesa mechanic and have him do the work.

Oh, and the inspection we used a Groupon for?  They charged us for services that i later found out were supposed to be part of the Groupon.  Going to call them today to try and get a refund for that $30 (?!)  tire rotation.

last time we ate at this ""establishment"" a cock roach crawled across the bar.  When we told the owner we were told that a shipment of produce was infected by roaches. No offer to refund the meal was offered. We delivered an email of disapproval to the owner upon which she responded with refunding the meal.

However, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.

""As a regular you know we have an ""A"" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.""

She refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. 

I show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that ""i'm not supporting her business"" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a ""B"" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.

Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?

At any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. 

Poor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.",review,6,Z1ha83pJkHXW6ZAaik6xxA

From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service. 
It took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left.

The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty.

About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say ""Excuse me, miss?"" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be.

If I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.

The first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good. 

This time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. 

The hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. 
Curry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. 

The waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. ""I'll be back"" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. 
Well waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   
Then I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. 
So in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! 

Anyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.

I was a little baffled when the scheduler told me the next available appointment was not until a few weeks, seeing as I clearly stated I need to get my lump on my breast examined. I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. 

As for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. 

She also gave me ""tips"" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...

There were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. 

I really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. 

I will NOT go back here again.

*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else. They basically lost my order and are going to research my situation and see what happened. I HAVE A LUMP ON MY BREAST and this is how they treat situations like this.

When you go into their offices for birth control they basically make you do an exam when you go in.  Well, I needed a new gynecologist and my boyfriend's mom recommended Central Phoenix OB/Gyn.  Since I hadn't gone to a professional before (besides planned parenthood) I thought I would give it a try.  The receptionist is VERY rude.  When we first got there we had to stand at the counter for 15 mins before she came out to give me my paperwork.  Her attitude isn't very welcoming, which is what pushed me away in the beginning.  First impressions are very important.  I had set an appointment with the Doctor, but come to find out that she wasn't in the office and they would have to schedule it with the NP (Nurse Practitioner).  I didn't get an exam like I was told, but she consulted me on my birth control and they took a STD test just so I could feel certain that I didn't have any.  They gave me a small discount for not being able to see the doctor ($185 Without insurance) and told me that they would contact me with the results from my test on Monday (a week from when I went).  Monday came and I got no calls.  I had another appointment scheduled not too far from then, so I decided to wait until I went back to the office.

The second visit I was scheduled with a doctor (that I did see that time) and was greeted by the oh so friendly receptionist.  I was told that they didn't have my test results (They LOST them) and that I would have to do another and they would take care of it.  They DIDN'T do any exam (AGAIN!) even though I was scheduled for it (I haven't had an exam for about 3 years now).  She just consulted me on the birth control and sent me on my way.  I had many questions, I have been having a lot of pain in my lower abdomen which is why I needed to be checked, and she just seemed to be rushing through all of them with no care.  I told her I was frequently urinating and I haven't been drinking a lot of water.  Her solution was that I was drinking a lot of water (I thought I just told her I didn't drink a lot) and that everything was fine.  I was a little frustrated, but that's fine.  I got to the front desk and I had to pay $250 for a consultation and no exam!  They called me a week later and I assumed it was for my results... NOPE.  They had ""forgotten"" to charge me, even though they told me since they screwed up the first time they would take care of it, and I had to pay another $250 for the lab!  That's ridiculous.

There are too many mistakes in this office for anyone to just overpass.

This is the nearest grocer for downtown residents, and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.

On any day, the parking lot is covered in grease, coffee, and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers, then the heavens are smiling on you.

Once inside the store, your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store, to be fair they have all the stuff you need, and at a reasonable price point.

The huge problem here, is everything else. During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.

It really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit. At each opportunity to impress, the complete opposite happens.

I have officially decided I am never going back here again. I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.
It's that bad.
Not only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:
1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.
2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!
3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.
4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!
5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.
6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.
7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be ""checked out"" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.
8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.

Oh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.
If Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.
It's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.

Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.

They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?

We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.

I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill.

I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry.

The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian.

Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. 
My daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty.

First off, it's BK so the quality of food is not great anyway, but this location tends to be more on the weak side.

No, that is EXACTLY why I was asking if I could get that deal because other BKs actually honor the coupon and its ambiguity. I said the coupon didn't specify but she handed me the coupon, roller her eyes like she had something better to do, and said it only applied to REGULAR Whoppers.

I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my ""I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends"" template.
 
 Majerle's is one of those experiences.

I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.
 When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.
 
   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. 
  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. 
Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.
Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.
 If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.",review,0,ClItHsk05vOKhg4O3DtMqw

I was waiting in a long line for a taxi home from Phx Sky Harbor. When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.

Okay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. 

I sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. 

When I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.

About an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the ""story"". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police.

I've tried on two separate occasions, but their dispatch team has never allowed me to get that far and has MAJOR customer service issues. The only reason I've ever called this company is because their phone number is so easy to remember.

On my most recent call to the company (which just happened to be last night), I had to call from a pay phone because my cell phone battery died. Someone answered about 6 rings later and mumbled ""hello,"" no mention of the company or even the employee's name. 

I asked for a ride home from the Phoenix Public Library over on Central and McDowell, and the dispatcher asked for the address. I told him I don't know the address and he told me to ""ask someone for it."" I explained that I can't just walk around asking for the address because I'm on a payphone and there is no one within 30 feet of me. So he responded, ""Oh, well, I need an address to get a cab to you."" I ended up looking through a stack of torn up phone books searching for the address while he held a conversation with one of his co-workers. None of them listed the library address and the dispatcher hung up on me after a minute.

I called another cab company immediately afterwards and had absolutely no problem with them.

Ok, the old Hotel San Carlos here is serving a weekday lunch buffet, so of course I stopped in to try it.  Today was Mexican food day, & they had a small setup of 16 items, which might be ok as long as the food is good.

I started with some of what they said was Tortilla Soup, in a styrofoam bowl.  Next, there was a bit of salad, & then it was on to the refried beans, which were cold, tasteless, & the consistency of the clay we had back in grade school.  They also featured nearly tasteless chimichangas, enchiladas, & tacos.

Over at my table there was a pitcher of WARM water to drink!

The service was awful, & so was most of the food.  Factoring in price ($7.99), it was worse than Taco Bite!     :-O",review,10,ikm0UCahtK34LbLCEw4YTw

The worst part is the ""manager"".  Shortly after checking in (mid-afternoon), we decided this is not going to work.  We took our luggage back downstairs and turned in the key, leaving the room exactly as it was when we arrived.  The desk clerk called the manager, who said we would be charged one nights room + a $50 early departure fee.  We asked to speak with the manager and were told she would not talk to us.

I complained and instead of resolving the issue, she called the police to have me removed from the premise.

We found out the day of the show that the production was cancelled due to an injury in the cast.  Completely understandable and I was happy to reschedule.  Due to travel for work, the only other show I could make was the last showing on Sunday.  

Unfortunately, I was delayed due to weather in the East Coast and missed the show.  The Phoenix Theater box office has rather limited phone hours and I was unable to get a hold of anyone.  Finally, on the day following the show, I spoke with a person who basically refused to help me in any capacity.

I would have been happy with a refund, an exchange, a coupon for a cookie, anything.  But instead the Phoenix Theater took my money ($180) and said ""Sorry.""  Surprising given the fact that I've found other venues very accommodating (looking at you Gammage).

Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.

I will never, ever return.

When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.

We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.

Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.

A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.

He approaches me and says ""Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?""
Me: ""Excuse me?""
BT: ""You're making a mess""
Me: ""I would like to order a drink, not get hassled""
BT: ""I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips""
Me: ""Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment""
BT: ""Are you going to order or not?""

I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.

He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.

He returns with the receipt. On the ""tip"" line I write ""NoFuckingWay!""
I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.

A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.

Yes, I am cut off.

I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.

I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.

Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.

I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.

Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this ""manager"" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.

This ""manager"" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm

Have been there twice this year - what a mistake to go back!  First time we went for Challenge Nation - an event C&W was hosting registration for that was almost 1,000 people I think.  Guess how many people were working? TWO.  They even had someone who was participating in the event eating/drinking before who USED to work at C&W help out because they were so swamped.  Bad staffing doesn't even begin to cover it....

Decided to try it again before a concert at US Air and give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a huge event that most restaurants would probably struggle accomodating.  We had to wait 10 minutes for water (which is just a delight after walking in 110 degree weather), then the waiter said he'd be right back and promptly went to every other table in our vicinity except ours until we had to flag him down to put in drink orders.  The service the remainder of the time was mediocre at best.  Had to order some drinks at the bar because we never were able to find our waiter for new beers or water refills.

Wrote a review on Southwest's Rapid Rewards Dining site and got contacted by the manager apologizing for the bad experiences.  I thought - WOW, that is not consistent with the service received at all - what a great way to step up and take ownership of your restaurant.  He asked me to email him about my experience and that he would send a gift card to return so they could make it up and try to ""switch me back.""  

I emailed him - that was a month ago - no response received at all!!!!

Coach and Willie's probably deserves better, but for what we paid and the quality of food we got, I have to do what I have to do.  Here goes...

We had been given tickets to the Diamondbacks game and, not too familiar with the area, this was the first place we found. The game was starting in a little over an hour when we showed up. Even at that, we did not get bad service, the one star is primarily directed at the food, which was not good.

I get very dismayed when something on the menu sounds really good and is such a disappointment. I ordered the Baja Fish Wrap. I love fish tacos and this sounded like something in the same vein. They do give you a choice of sides. I chose the wedge salad. The fish was bland. The lavosh wrap around it was soggy and falling apart. The menu promised spicy sauce... again bland. The wedge salad was a travesty. It was just an unwieldy wedge of lettuce with a small amount of dressing on it. It took up over half the plate. When you tried to cut it it made everything slide off the other side. I gave up on it after the first few bites. It wasn't worth the work and mess. My wife had a nearly identical experience with her tequlila-lime chicken wrap... no flavor at all in any of the food.

I am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The ""chips"" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. 

Altogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality.

Two weeks ago we sat at our table and we waited 40 minutes until we saw our server. And this only after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation.

Jason, 
Maybe you should get YOUR facts straight before posting a reply.  We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was.  Your manager walked over with our ticket and said "" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food"" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied "" well we're busy and short-handed"" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game.  Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink.  Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses.  We did NOT demand to speak to the owner.  He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner.  She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,"" I just saw him"", your manager then said "" I'll go get the owner for you."" There was no demanding there.  Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining.  The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back.  Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped.  We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken.

I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.

We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. 

I'm not really high on the ""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time"" style of user review.

Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. 

I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.

The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.

Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- ""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!""

I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us.

She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.  

She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the month?

The waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!

We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.

The waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!

Then comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  

So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  

So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is ""At least they didn't fuck up the rice"", we are in some ugly territory here people.  

If you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night.  Nuf sed.",review,4,h9q8a0HyM71VeD86-IbaSQ

I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.

It was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.

Aesthetics:
Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.

I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?

Service:
I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.

Food:
I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. 

The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. 

I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.
My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. 

Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.

Now for the nasty part.
I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.

It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.

Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.

There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. 

Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.
The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. 
Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years.
Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.",review,9,HZeFzs42f0iGaA-sP_hUnA

First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that.

It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).

My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long.  Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.

The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.

The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.

It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food.  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes.",review,3,QrOSr8bzAjpIgyNftDLUBg

As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).

So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.

The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the ""atmosphere"" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves ""authentic Asian"" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.

Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?

""I'm Mexican"" whispered one lady ""I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes"". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home.

It seems like the kind of place that you can drop into for a cocktail on a nice Saturday afternoon.  But...

The menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade.  Some people would find that charming, but we found it a bit trying.  Also, it was written on one piece of white paper.  There were NO descriptions of any of the food.  So we had to ask the wait staff about the items we were interested in, which would have been fine, but...

The wait staff.  Hmph. A bit slow.  And totally unknowledgable.  They didn't know what was in the items.  We asked, and then items showed up with things on it that we were not expecting (and didn't like).

The food was NOT GOOD.  I ordered the shawarma.  It was TERRIBLE.  No flavor at all.  The chicken was boiled and had no seasoning.  The tahini sauce had no flavor at all.  I asked for some taztiki sauce to see if it would help.  It did not.  It was the WORST shawarma I have ever had.  However, the potato salad was tasty.

The BF had the lamb gyro which he said was nothing special (very average).  And my friend ordered the italian sandwich, which he liked.  For the price of the food, everything should have tasted better.

Drinks were expensive.  A rum and coke in a place that looks and feels like a dive bar was $7.  SERIOUSLY?  Wow.  Unless you go during happy hour, the prices don't seem worth it.  They did have a good beer selection, and all of those (besides the super cheap ones) were $5 each.  That seemed reasonable.

Baja Fresh is a poor man's chipotle, but that's an insult to poor men everywhere.

First off, I think everyone in Phoenix is missing the gene where they actually listen to directions.  When you order something, you shouldn't get ANOTHER.  Totally got that, it ruined the start of my vacation and it made me sick the entire time I was in Phoenix.  Ironically, I never stepped into a Baja before, but I learned my lesson to eat dirt rather than eat here.

I ordered a burrito bowl (I think it's called ""bare"" burrito), and I asked for whatever the hell it was, and you have to special order steak or chicken.  I said neither but Iwanted guac.  No problem they told me.  I hate chicken and I got it anyway.  I didn't know until I got back to my conference.  Note to self: they fuck you in the drive-thru.

I've been here with friends about three times now, two of them to watch a fight, the other time because it was the only place within walking distance that had food.  All three times our waitress was rude and largely absent.  I'll add that we are really not into the whole TnA aspect of this restaurant, and treat our waitress like any other waitress.  No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.

We went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered ""hot"" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.

Friend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.

Friend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, ""Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?""  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.

Overall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).

My friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, ""Umm, can we get some service??"" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. 

This blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for ""not seeing"" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. 

My friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,""Sorry guys."" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great.

I have never heard of such and as stated I ate at quite a few locations.

Soon the manager (I assume) came over and stated that she can show me where it states breaded.

It doesn't state it on the menu which is common if something is breaded.

Also she said that it was a new item at that location for about 6 months.

I ended up sending it back, because it was not what I anticipated and didn't want breaded and battered food.

Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed ""rooms"" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.

I've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.

Once inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!

Our server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.

The food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.

Bread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue ""I can't believe it's not butter"" for false advertising.

The salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the ""balsamic"" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.

There are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent?

I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, ""What did you have in mind?""  She said ""How about The Old Spaghetti Factory"".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said ""Sure, I always like to try new places."" 

We were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said ""Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.""  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.

Having been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my ""lazy"" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.

Our waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied ""Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size."".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying ""I told the busboy to bring it to you.""  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.

My friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.  

Sadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the ""butter"" added nothing.

All I could think was ""Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!"", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice.",review,3,2XkQ8Uowu3HJZXGmqdHgZQ

I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine.  It was possibly the worst pasta dish I have ever had.  The chicken was so dry I could not eat it.  It tasted like it was either boiled, reheated or a little of both.  The cold stale pasta and sauce did little to compliment it, so I picked the broccoli out and that was that.  I wonder how they are teaching servers nowadays because when I was still in the industry and two plates looked untouched we were taught to inquire about what was wrong.  I did not feel the need to complain because as I stated before the manager was obviously too busy hanging out nonchalantly to care about my awful dish.

The 2 horrible things about this dish were : #1 it's $9.50 and you get the tiniest little cup of dip...seriously...so teeny tiny!!!! Give me a break! And just a handful of stale chips. #2 Who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip? At least SAY SO in the title...when you read ""Spinach Artichoke Dip"" you just assume that's what it will be. Who reads the description, anyway (still, I will take ownership of that part). It was so gross...we sent it back. 

Then the dinner salad. A small plate of iceberg lettuce and a few croutons. Really? 

Then the worst...the cheeseburger. I asked if their medium was still a bit pink inside and was assured that it was. I realize some places interpret medium rare and medium differently which is way I always clarify. Well, this wasn't even close. It was cooked WELL. It was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency. Also, it was so bland. No seasoning or anything. Our waiter asked if I wanted them to cook me another one but even if they got the meat temperature right it still would have been nasty with no taste, so I passed and just sent it back. 

I did eat the fries because I was hungry and it was the only edible thing I got (and not even that good). 

Lastly...our waitress. She sucked. Never checked on us, seemed to not really care, and it wasn't busy so it's not like she was in the weeds or anything. Needless to say we won't be visiting ever again. We're gonna stick with The Strand down the street.",review,1,sTYxqAOh7hqHfmfQry22lw

Couldn't see it until I returned home and the sunlight revealed exterior body scratches.  Evidently they didn't take care to use clean rags/towels.  Looks like a Brillo pad was used.

Well, I'll keep my review the same.  Took my car in this morning to see what could be done.  A ""charming"" older woman (JOVEL) came out to tell me this was definitely not caused by them an it was without a doubt caused by a buffer.  I explained to her that a buffer had not touched my car since it was last detailed by European Detail over six months ago.  To my face she told me I was not providing the truth and if I took it to a BMW dealership they would also confirm I was ""lying"".

Guess what!!  BMW confirmed that the damage was likely caused by rags because of the linear motion that was apparent.  Rick was the gentleman from Los Olivos who accompanied me.  When he also learned that perhaps I wasn't lying as JOVEL had certainly alleged he offered a re-wash and a had wax to correct the problem.  Thank you Rick for obeing a professional.  

Even upon return to the Wash JOVEL was still had her heals dug in refusing to acknowledge any error on their part.

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. 

We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. 

Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. 

We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a ""few more minutes."" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!

It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. 

As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. 

My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the ""Greek"" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!

I drive past it all the time on the way to work and have long thought it would be convenient to do business at this location. The hours on the door indicated they were open until 5:30 and I arrived right at 5pm. The branch was empty with the exception of a few employees. I was greeted by one of the tellers. I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony. 

Anthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business.

One benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process. I was literally done by 5:18. At which point his attitude improved significantly. 

The very next day I received a follow-up call from the Sunwest Federal Credit Union loan team. They needed some additional information which I was happy to provide. I'm not sure what it is about the folks at this Credit Union but again I got a huge amount of attitude. It was clear she felt bothered to have to deal with me. 

Ultimately I decided to take my business elsewhere. There are just too many other banks and credit unions that would appreciate my time and business.

Went with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game. 

The place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.

Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them. 

Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*

Most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.

It's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I""m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one.

The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. 

But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! 

My other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm! 

I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously. 

It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation. 
It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals! 

So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit. 

Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too, I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area. 

Before this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well.

Why? Because I just can't stand  the lady who owns and runs it (and cooks your way-too-overpriced food). She's rude. I work in the building and have eaten there on many desperate occasions. The food is pricey (go to Schlotzky's across the street for better value). And it's really not that good. It tastes ok... nothing special at all though.

She's ALWAYS out of something I want, literally every single time I'm there (no potato salad, no bacon, no ham, no tomatoes). What sort of fresh breakfast/lunch place is out of tomatoes at 9 AM? I like ham on my breakfast burrito (comes with three choices: bacon, ham, or sausage). At 8 AM, how does one run out of both bacon and ham (the sausage is kind of odd, I can't eat it) on a regular basis?

Despite me eating there for the past year on a somewhat consistent basis, paying cash every time, she still has to count EVERY last penny before she will even let me put my zingers in a bag.

Scenario: I see zingers I want, ask how much they are ($1), tell her I'm setting the money right here by the register, and since she's cooking, put 4 quarters neatly stacked right near the register (as she watches me and my 4 quarters like a hawk). Then, she finishes my burrito, puts it in a bag, and I go to put the zingers in the bag as well. BAD IDEA! No! Must go count all 4 quarters before they can even enter that bag to sit alongside the tiny $4 burrito I have already paid for! She honestly acts paranoid that people are trying to steal from her or jip her, even with her regular customers. It's no wonder the place is always empty. If you go, and see more than two other people in there at lunch time, consider it a miracle.

And, it's not just me. I'm always polite, say please and thank you, smile. Never let on that I can't stand this woman at all. Everyone on my floor has the exact same thing to say and will only eat down there when they are really desperate and in a time crunch. Most of the people here would rather run across the street to Burger King (and most of the people around me make enough money to consider Burger King beneath them, so that actually says a lot.) Even more go to the 2700 Tower's little store (read below)... they are always busy (but you can still get in and out fast).

This past visit to Central Cafe, there was a small bowl of little chocolates sitting by the register, half empty. She hasn't had those before, and there was no sign on them to indicate any sort of price. My friend, assuming they were free, took a single one and ate it, to then be informed to cough up a quarter! My friend said ""oh, there's no sign. Everybody has these out for everyone."" No... that did not fly. The lady had to have her quarter. I gave her two dimes and 5 pennies. And she counted every single last penny, slowly (we would not want to miss a penny, would we?)

She will probably know who I am after writing this review, but at this point, I really don't care. I have no intention of ever eating there again. I've decided I won't be that desperate again. I've come to the conclusion I'd rather not eat first.

If you want something super quick nearby, try the 2700 tower's little shop (right by the smoking area, next to the entrance to their parking garage), the next building north of our 2600/Central Cafe Tower. The Asians who run it are always very pleasant, also cook basics (think burger, hot dog, burrito, fresh sandwiches wrapped up, etc), and their prices are really reasonable for on-the-go food. They are more of a mini-Circle-K with a small corner where they make food (more diverse options than Central Cafe), all fresh and all pretty cheap for a downtown Phoenix office building shop. And they don't elaborately count every cent, stare at customers, and treat every patron with suspicion... in fact, they're liberal with the Leave-a-Penny-Take-a-Penny jar. More cramped store, but a much better place to grab something quick and not feel like a thief just for coming in!",review,2,2fV_aUYoiXFfBMyc3Zx0Xw

Full of 2nd-rate restaurants and trinket shops, it just doesn't have much draw.  (Sam's Cafe is really the only restaurant here that I go to much.)

Rather than putting the theater (blank walls) in the center with the shops and restaurants around it to create a vibrant urban space, they killed the street-facing ability of much of this block by turning it outside-in and into a little suburban ""enter me and leave the city"" area.   You combine that with the concept of 2nd floor retail (again a suburban mall concept), and this place is a complete failure.  Notice nothing exists on the 2nd floor.  Even if it had 3x the foot-traffic nothing could survive up there, because no one would ever see anything on a 2nd floor in-passing on their way to something else and thereby never ""discover"" it.

My coleslaw was pretty good, the fries were crispy but rather bland, (why didn't they season them?). 

But the big problem were the ribs. I have never had ribs that had the consistency of being boiled. That's right, ""boiled"", as in water!  (Or maybe they keep them soaked in water?). Either way they were almost inedible because my idea of ribs should be BBQ'd in a smoker and then I suppose reheated on a flame grill, right? But to be soggy, wet, fatty and without any real smoky flavor? Come on, for what I spent what a terrible value!

By the way I left $1+ change in the tip cup when I placed my order at the counter and got my change but I didn't receive a thank you for it.

Ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with dark meat (does not like breast meat)  and drink for my husband to take with him because he wasn't hungry.  We sat down with my meal and ate, he had not gotten his meal yet.  About 20-25 min later, went to counter to get his meal and they didn't even have it ready!  Then they said, oh, is the white meat ok?  We don't have any of the dark meat ready right now?  After 25 minutes and they didn't have any ready? Husband reluctantly said ok.  Got home and later ate it and it was all dried out and appeared old.  We will not be going back, the customer service is terrible and so is their food these days.

I went there on a Saturday a little over one month ago.  I ordered a slab of ribs, beans, slaw, and sweet potato pie to go [wanted peach cobbler, but they were out].  I was really looking forward to some good ribs.  I arrived to pick-up my order and there was a line of three parties ahead of me at the cash register.  No big deal until the sassy young lady at the register spent 15 minutes talking and checking out the first person in line.  While I stood getting frustrated from waiting so long to just pick up food, the second and third parties in front of me left because they too were tired of waiting.  

When it was finally my turn, I mentioned to the young lady, ""do you realize that two parties in front of me walked out because they were tired of waiting""?  When I said this, an older lady that appeared to be the manager stopped dead in her tracks as she was walking by.  She asked the young lady at the cash register what was going on.  The young lady stated that I told her two parties had just walked out because they were tired of waiting.  The manager said, ""oh"" and went on about her business like it was no big deal.  When I paid my bill, the young lady stated, ""your food is over there,"" pointing to the other end of the counter about 6 feet away.  I asked if there was extra sauce with my meal and she told me extra sauce is always included with ribs.  

I get home with my order and am ready to chow down on some ribs and the first thing I notice is there is no extra sauce with my meal as I was told.  I opened up the plate of ribs and was quite surprised when I took a bite.  I think these ribs may have been walked past the smoker at some point, but that is about all.  No smokey flavor, no smokey color, just a big disappointment.  The beans were very good, the slaw appeared to be a premade product, and the potato pie was o.k.  However, I really wanted the cobbler they had on the menu but were out of.  

I admit that I am a BBQ junkie and have high expectations of such food.  But I had heard such high reviews of Honey Bears and these ribs were so bad.  I honestly ate half of the slab and tossed the rest in the trash.  I paid ~$30 dollars for this single meal and was insulted by the treatment of their staff.

Originally came here because well I did enjoy the Van Buren location.  On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.

Upon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.

First things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area. 

*I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?

Price... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.

Ordered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)

My girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)

I will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.

brother and i went in saturday 041214 to use a Groupon and it was a hassle- if you don't want to deal with Groupons, you can always, y'know, NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM VOLUNTARILY. then we were told multiple different prices with the excuse 'uh, certain specials aren't allowed to be used'. well a) that isn't noted anywhere b) the items ordered were on the menu, not listed as 'special' c) they told us we had to order the full amount to get the discount, which is not how ANY Groupon deal i have used works (ie, the $20 credit wouldn't kick in until we ordered $20 worth of food. yeah, what? its a $20 credit! if we ordered $18, that means its all covered, not that we need to buy another side we didn't want!)

on top of that, we only got half our order at first, my brother went to ask about his and was told he cancelled the other half of the order. the part that was paid for and on the receipt? at this point he was pretty annoyed and the on duty manager came out and was condescending and telling him to calm down. then was told that his order was being made fresh so it was gonna be awhile- only to have it come up right then. this trip didn't make sense and they didn't really seem to care. not really in a rush to go back ever at this point. your bbq is ok, but i can go to Astor House up the street and not deal with this kind of headache.

When you walk in to any service business you expect a certain amount of kindness and professionalism. Well not here. we were met with a rude cashier who kept screaming NEXT as if there was no one in line. Next I saw all these signs telling you what you can't do in this place like do not dump anything in the soda dispenser drain and check your order before you leave and so on. Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago. 

Bottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it. The staff is so bad that I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. The owners should be aware that the service of this place has gotten to the point that people won't even go there so they don't have to deal with the worst service they have ever had.

I remembered that I had a an old groupon that I had bought so we decided to try it. When we first walked in it did seem a little ghetto but I know sometimes smaller places are better. We ordered a full slab Of pork ribs and 2 drinks. It came with 2 sides an with tax was about $30. My groupon was for $20 but was expired so I thought I would only get the amount I paid, $10. The only positive thing about our experience was that they honored my groupon for the full $20.

The cashier was not polite at all, not wanting to even take my groupon at first. You could tell he didn't want to be working.  Another employee was sitting in plain sight eating a large plate with no manners and looking gross. I went to get some lemonade and it tasted like water so I dumped it out and got root beer. About 10 min after we sat down they called our number but only to say that they were out of ribs! The place had 2 customers on a Friday night and the special was rib tips..but they only had chicken! They offered an extra side but no change in the price... Then while we were eating I heard another customer who had come in long after us, being old that they were out of ribs and the customer was upset that he had already paid for ribs too! I don't understand why they were letting people order and pay for ribs when it was clear they knew that they knew they didn't have any!

Worse, the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.

Specifically, I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went, a few weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today, there was four times the cheese, at least two or three times the sauce, along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.

Worse, the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed, showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.

My friend and I chose to check it out on a mellow weekday afternoon and we did not even eat/drink here because of the initial impression we received. We walked into the front entry and saw there was only one couple at a table and it was slow due to the time of day. We looked around and eventually expected to see anyone who worked there as we awkwardly waited near the hostess stand for several minutes. Finally, a server emerged who did not even acknowledge us in any way and went to help the one table. After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list. At that point, we were pretty much over this place as we did not want to see how much worse the service might get if we actually stayed. I was really disappointed that the experience was so bad without even trying the place as I was really looking forward to finding a new downtown restaurant.",review,2,zCBtnQGfDsAXGNY_OIXn5A

Wrong.

These kids played their heart out - tremendous talent. It was great, honestly refreshing - most of the bands were better than anything they play on the radio.

The venue - you know a place created by a musician? A place that has rock & roll memorabilia all over the walls - a restaurant supposed to celebrate music?

Complete and total let down. Alice Cooper, you should be ashamed.

The venue didn't even bother to take the time to set up tables and chairs for the parents, teachers, and sponsor supporting them.

There was basically zero wait staff.

At least half the tables in the outdoor area (where the stage was set-up) were high-tops - which would have been fine - if there were chairs to go with them.

Instead everyone was sitting in those El' Cheapo $5 green plastic lawn chairs. This not only was uncomfortable, but it negated the entire usefulness of the high top tables. 

At least 4 times during the 2 hours I head the phrase ""Please tip well"" and ""Please make sure you tip the wait staff well.""

There was NO wait service - at all. You had to walk up to the counter and order. They had one poor employee trying to pick up all the empty cups/trash from a decent sized group of people.

I would rather give my ""tip"" money to the kids to buy more drum sticks guitar strings than give to a place that could care less about providing a comfortable place to watch talented kids play great music. Why would I tip people who did nothing to provide their services (you know...food?)

They had the top balcony section closed - I do not know why - our group would have loved to sit up there and hear the kids. But I guess when you have a whopping two or three tables to wait on inside (not related to the event, the place was a ghost town except for the people there to see the kids) it would be too much trouble to go up some stairs.

If they actually cared - and had staff there to support the event (3-4 waiters/waitresses would have been sufficient) they could have made some really good money off food sales.


I certainly hope that in the future they secure somewhere that cares enough to at least properly set up the area for people to attend/sit. Heaven forbid the place actually function like a restaurant should and try to serve food/beverage.

It is a shame the rest of the competition is being held there. The kids deserve so much better.",review,0,U2f4haSnEtcRWvBzb4k30w

Had burgers there in the past and was very happy.  The Following is a quote from their menu, word for word:

""""Rusty Wallace"" St Louis Ribs.  St. Louis cut pork ribs smothered in dry rub and slow smoked to perfection, then lightly sauced with Cattlemen's BBQ sauce, and flashed on the flame broiler.""

I was hungry and came in about 20 minutes before close and was waited on by Matt.  I ordered ice tea and asked Matt if the ribs had been cooked recent or a long time ago and reheated.  And told him that if it was the latter that I wouldn't be having them.  He said he would ask the chef, came back and proceeded to say ""the bartender had them and said they were good"".  Hmmmm, that wasn't what I asked, but noted his answer in my mind and proceeded to order......Yes the ribs with two sides.

The food comes and it was exactly what I was afraid of, Ribs that had been boiled, then cooked in a oven and braised in marginal bbq sauce.  I ate them and it filled my stomach.  When he came by with the check, he asked ""so how were the ribs"".  I made him go get a menu and read the above quote. And then nicely without being a jerk told him that the establishment was falsely advertising the ribs.  I explained that I have smoked all meats in a wood fired barrel smoker for over 20 years and I would welcome the opportunity to go in the back and see where the ribs were slow smoked, if what I was saying was wrong.  I also explained that I had been out of tea for 10 minutes and I was a big boy and could handle the truth of how old the ribs were.  He then said that he didn't know how old they were.  Then without apologizing, asked how I was going to pay?  Really?????

The check was $20.45, and Matt got NO tip.  I had breakfast yesterday at a very popular, very busy establishment...No Relation....Matts BB, Great service and added a $5 tip to a $13 bill...no I'm not a cheapskate.

They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that ""EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round""... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine.

We took into consideration this is a venue that at pre-game becomes overwhelmed with an influx of customers in a short period of time.  However that does not excuse the staff for putting a table of 2 on a waiting list only to forget about them for 45 minutes while tables are cleared and other guests are seated.  When we went back to check the status, the response was ""oops, sorry your information was not transferred from the iPad"" (apparently there was some type of technology glitch).  The response was then that we would be next, so let the wait begin some more.  When our pager did activate, we were given an option to have a view (which would require an additional wait) or be seated immediately.  We stated we would like a view but as we had now been waiting for nearly an hour didn't want to have another unreasonable wait for the view.  Apparently that response translated into ""seat these 2 in the darkest corner of the restaurant with absolutely no chance of even a glimpse of the field"".   After we were seated and realized that we could now be sitting inside any other TGIFridays (surrounded by solid red walls) the other guest in my party then returned to the hostess stand to inquire if maybe a better table with a view was coming available as we were celebrating a birthday (we did not use this line to play on sympathies, it was a birthday occasion - not that it mattered because there were no sympathies).  The hostess then said she would come find us and knew where we were currently seated, only to never be seen or heard from again.  The unapologetic attitude, the unwillingness to make reparations for an obvious oversight and error on the staff's part, and the poor food quality have me hoping this place closes their doors as so many other TGIFridays across the Valley already have and will hopefully be reopened by a restaurateur that knows customer service, food quality, and overall restaurant management (my vote - Four Peaks!).  

As far as the food is concerned, it is what you would expect from a mass produced, crowd fulfillment perspective.  I sympathize with the cooks that are trying to appease the masses, but during our extended wait period we had the opportunity to watch customer after customer complain about the food quality and send items back (in particular there seemed to be an overall dislike for the burgers, which appeared to be frozen meat slabs with no originality to the toppings that would have at least helped to mask the gray color and rubbery texture - yuck)",review,0,QGlSHuhPzA-jmeRi50JAEg

In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.

We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122

Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658

As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of ""gyro meat"" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.

I move on to my side of potato salad.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283

Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.

Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.

And, the price did not include parking, which for me, ended up being another $5.00.  At the end of the day, I ended up paying $38.00 just for one person.

As far as the Van Gogh exhibit, the concept was interesting but unfortunately, the children in the other exhibit next door were so incredibly loud that you could  hear their screaming, which was louder than the music playing in the Van Gogh exhibit.  Additionally, a couple of women brought their children into this exhibit, which was quite clearly for adults, and the kids were noisy as well.

The Van Gogh exhibit was ok-I really do not know why this exhibit was at this museum as it did not relate to science and it was geared to adults- not kids like everything else at this museum.  The other exhibits might have been interesting but there were unruly children running around and screaming all over the place.

My last stop was to the planetarium-I saw the Grand Tour of the Planets.  This was god awful. There was a woman narrator who talked the entire time about the planets but again, her presentation was geared to little kids.  I felt like I was in kindergarden listening to her.

1. In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.

2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.

For # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was ""Michael"". He basically told me to ""try harder"" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No ""excuse me"" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.

As for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer. Ughhhh.",review,1,yuPBS3fak77lgwO_9SXVYQ

Boy, was I sorry. 

Let's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my ""stranger bubble"" and I was forced to move my seat at the table. Next, there were the chips which were just ok to begin with, and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad. Then, hubby's machaca chimi was fine, with decent flavor, but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible. You could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the Body Worlds exhibit. Gross, I know, but so was this meat. It simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant.

7495,hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA,0,2011-09-07,0,-UJkqcdlx8bXXxfrw2QfeA,1,"We have a contest going on at work. We choose a type of food we like, then go out and find 5 different restaurants to try that type of food from. Whichever restaurant we rank highest is where we'll go when we're in the mood for that type of food. There are 4, sometimes 5 of us so the winning restaurants get a nice sale each time we go out. I let the cashiers/owners know about our contest up front so they know we'll be back (plenty) if they win. We've done Gyros (Z's Greek wins), Burgers (Chicago Hamburger Company wins), and now we're doing hard shell tacos.  

Today we tried Rosita's place. I walked in and let the lady know about our contest. She asked what restaurants we planned to try then mentioned that we shouldn't include franchise restaurants because their food will be cheap and sub-par and cannot touch a family restaurant like hers. I appreciated her opinion. 

I started my order by asking if I could substitute one of the ground beef tacos in the combination plate for chicken and was given an emphatic NO. She said it costs them extra for the meat so it was only fair to charge us extra. So, I kindly paid an extra 2.50 to get a machaca and chicken taco in my combo and continued the order. I asked for mild salsa with one pair of tacos and was told ""we have red and green and everyone will get both"". 4 of us ordered a total of 8 tacos, 1 combination plate, and an order of chips and salsa. Total sale was around 33 bucks.  

I get back to the office and hand out the food and this is when we realized that we got CHIPS AND HOT SAUCE, not Chips and Salsa which was a very unpleasant surprise. Many of the chips were chewy and soggy and we threw most of the bag away because of this. I expected white meat in my 3.00 chicken tacos but received dark, greasy meat. I thought a family restaurant will always provide quality meat?? The machaca was so overloaded with grease that the lettuce turned gray and slimy and the hard taco turned soft and mushy. I literally had to POUR the grease out. The chicken was flavorless and we didn't get cheese on any of the tacos. Let me guess, only fair they charge extra for cheese?? 

Not all of our tacos were as bad as mine but we all expected better flavor, cheese on our tacos, white-meat chicken, the ability to mix and match taco choices, and salsa with our chips; after all, a family restaurant will always be better quality than a franchise, RIGHT? The beans and rice were pretty good and while I do like my hot sauce hot I feel they substitute flavor with spice. 

All in all, I give Rosita's Place 3 out of 1000 stars (for the rice and beans and that's sad). I also found it offensive and absurd that they would openly slam on franchise restaurants when a Filiberto's or Chipotle taco blows the doors off of Rosita's Place. All of us agreed that this place would be at the bottom of the list come time to choose a winner. This is obviously not saying any other entree they have is just as bad; I'm only discussing their tacos. I was waiting all week to get some good tacos and am highly disappointed. It's safe to say I will never go to this restaurant again.",review,1,0SU1oBnMlqgMVuRs2mb9wA

Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles, and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor. The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a ""party"" motel. And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint? I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit. He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $150.00 cleaning deposit if we smoked. Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke. LoL....  And nobody in my family smokes. I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said, ""Well, looks like we came to the right place honey""'

I was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building. I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black. Old gum, some kind of splash stains, trash, all in view on the way to the room.  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up. They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded? 

One of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered. I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out. I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm. I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant. She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes. I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation. We went back and hung out in our other room. DISGUSTING. The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint, dust, and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed.  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area. There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time.  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex? Seriously?  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom. Gross. I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can. We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed. 

After an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised. I went back to the front office for some coffee. The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room. And that it had aired out pretty good. I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here. After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them, and the condition of the room, I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go.  So I did. I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into. And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues. 

Later that night after two of my kids showered. their tub (in room 108, the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain. I walked back to the front office and met the lady again. She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already. I now asked for a new room. She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room. I never heard back from them the entire stay. Not to see if we were ok? Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)?  

The next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast. Ok at least they are trying I guess. But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you. He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people. 

We will never stay her again. And I feel like we should get a partial refund. I understand things happen. But this place is a joke. I would be embarrassed to work here. And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on. Just hard to believe people can just not care.

I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!

They raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.

Also, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.

The food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.

Also, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.

Did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.

Dr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  
Dr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.

Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  Right?

So we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.

We found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.

I sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.

I thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much?  It was the most depressing experience.

Ouch!

Bandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.

I've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong. The female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.

The squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under that tacky illuminated ""Bandaids Show Lounge"" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with ""Damn, I'mma get mugged out here"" uncertainty and darkness.

Once inside (yes, you go in through the sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar, another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat downs - *sub-standard, the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed ""no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees"" dress code tacked by the door. Classy!

After getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really really good-looking, hottest girl on staff, setting a false precedent for what the talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next, to the center stage.

Most of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up, and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, empty on a Friday night...
... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.
... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, amply-bossomed strippers.
... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.

Girl after girl (a couple+ of ""a'ight"" girls, most ""everyday"" girls, and at least one ""is that a girl?"") came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music, some exhibiting gymnast caliber pole skills and limberness, then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection ""Would you like a dance?  Would you like a dance?"".

None of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbies who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.

After a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of ""meh"" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...
...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...
...the summation of the Bandaids experience...
...that's when we saw it...

I was referred to Southwest Women's Care by a friend who was very impressed by the Ahwatukee office location and staff. This being my second pregnancy, I was prepared for the lengthy initial paperwork, long office waits, and moody receptionists; however, I was not at all prepared for complete and utter incompetence. I left my initial visit feeling ok with my OB selection, but in all honesty, I wasn't super impressed with the doctors or staff.  I rationalized the lackluster feelings as pregnancy hormones and made follow up appointments.  If my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be? I went through my new patient information packet and realized the PA who examined me failed to provide me a due date. Wow! Completely unbelievable! Everyone knows it's one of the most important components of the initial visit. I was able to figure it out using a pregnancy calculator but I couldn't believe the miss. 

During my visit I also set the expectation I would need FMLA paperwork filled out by 5/29/13--I stressed the importance of the forms and deadlines. The person assisting me said that my deadline wouldn't be an issue and assured me she would personally complete the forms if needed. Well, when I called this morning (5/29/13) to see if the forms were completed the receptionist seemed uninterested in my situation and chose to inform me they had ""7- 10 business days to complete any and all medical forms . . ."" to which I responded ""that is not what I was told at my visit and I need those forms as soon as possible."" She told me she would check into it and call me back. 
 
The receptionist did provide a prompt follow up call to let me know that they would be making an exception for my forms. She set the expectation that I would be able to pick them up after the office lunch break and left it at that. I was pleased with the quick response and went to pick up my forms as soon as I could. When I got to the office the front desk could not locate my paperwork and the lengthy wait time left little time for me to double check the forms. Imagine my dismay when I got back to my office to discover the forms were filled out completely incorrect.  There were contradictories, wrong information, and misspellings galore.  There is absolutely no way a medical professional could have completed the documents. When I checked the back signature, sure enough, it was different from the rest of hand writing on the forms.  I am completely appalled that a doctor or physicians assistant would sign off on forms without insuring they were filled out appropriately. 

There is no way I would let someone who can't even take the time to make sure basic documents are completed properly deliver my child.  An expectant mother needs someone who pays attention to details. If this is how they handle the little parts of pregnancy then I don't even want to think about how they handle the bigger parts.

I've attempted to go to this practice twice.
I shoulda learned after the first failed appointment- however, the convenience of their location coupled with my laziness made me go in for a second attempt.
Shame on me I guess.

The second appointment I had with them was actually made for the Tempe location (when I specifically asked for the Ahwatukee location), and then when I tried to reschedule something- they didn't have anything with a doctor for another month.

I venture down to the end of my block in my suit at 8:30 a.m.; and of course, even though it's supposed to be open at that time, all the door's are still locked.  None of the doors are clearly marked, so I wander around and end up at a door marked ""business"" something.  The door's locked, but I look inside and see a young woman who looks at me and points upstairs.  Keep in mind, I'm in a suit.  So I walk upstairs and form a line behind another guy who's waiting in front of another locked door.  

Fifteen minutes go by, and now there's a line of about 15 people, most of them in street clothes, and I'm standing there in a suit.  Great.  Finally the door opens (phew) and we all shuffle in and the receptionist hands us clipboards with forms to fill out.  I start filling out the form, but after trying to figure out why there's so many questions about my drug use, family life, and court mandates, I realize I must have the wrong form.  I walk up to the receptionist, tell her I'm from the court, and she laughes and says I'm in the wrong office, I need to go back downstairs.  

So I go downstairs, back to the same door I had originally gone to, and the young woman that originally pointed me upstairs laughs and asks me why I went upstairs.  Seriously?  But it doesn't end there, because then the woman hands me a cup, and I stand there like a moron because I thought they were going to draw blood or something (and I'm not sure why I thought that).  But of course I went to the bathroom right before I left my house, so I had to leave, drive to Starbucks, grab a bottle of water and a cup of coffee, drink them both down, and then head back to TASC to finish.

I had  DUI and was looking for an assessment to get my license back and then later to take the required classes.  I had the option of going to several counseling centers but looked at going to TASC because it is near my work.  The amount of hours that they wanted me to have was reasonable but they wanted me to participate in their color systems, the same system drug offenders have to use for their probation.  I initially signed on to it but after realizing that I would have to call every single weekday and possibly come in to pee (regardless if I was across town or not) at a fee of $20 each time.  Wow.  What a scam.

So I called to tell them that I decided to use another facility that doesn't have such ridiculous rules and the counselor/head of TASC was screaming at me over the phone telling me that I was a dishonest abuser who just didn't want to take their UA tests.  I told her, you are right.  I don't want to call every day and pay you ungodly money because I DON""T HAVE TO.  I told her that furthermore, judging by her attitude and customer service skills I can see that the only customers that she will ever have are the ones that the courts FORCE to go to them

I really feel bad for those that have to go to TASC, The staff is rude and the whole thing is a scam.  They charge ungodly money for the tests and the system requires so many random tests that, in my opinion, it is set up for people to not be able to make it or fail.

If you have a choice, DO NOT go to TASC, they just want your money and they think you are nothing but a piece of shit.  Even their head counselors are used to screaming at and demeaning their customers.

On a blazing hot Friday afternoon I left work early and drove all the way down to McDowell to pick up some toys for my dog. I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close, and my watch was just about at 4:30. I reached to open the door, unsure if it would be locked-- to my pleasant surprise, it was still open, I was so excited. The cashiers allowed me to head back to the warehouse-- again, I was relieved! I made a beeline for the toys and just a few feet before I reached them one of the workers pops out, literally stands in the middle of the aisle with his arms crossed (as if I were trying get backstage at a concert), and tells me the business is closed and that I had to leave. I told him that I just needed to grab a couple of toys, that I would need 2 minutes (under the circumstances, I would have been quick), but he wouldn't let me pass. When I politely persisted he asked me what toys I was interested in, and told me he would get them for me. I told him that I couldn't possibly know what they had in stock and that I just needed to visually see what they had (and how the heck do you describe some of these dog toys anyway??). No dice, he told me that I had to go. Really?? 

Inflexible, embarrassing, and a total wasted trip. I was steamed. Rather than ask for a manager when I was agitated, I decided to drive home and email customer service. They emailed back the following Monday and told me, essentially, the employee did was he was supposed to do, blaming it on concern for customer safety with all of the heavy equipment they utilize after hours in the warehouse. Mind you that I had been let in building, that nobody stopped me from entering the warehouse, that it had maybe just turned 4:30, that there were other customers there, that there was no heavy equipment in sight and that I had asked for 2 minutes. They were perfectly fine with their employee telling me that I had to leave, and they made no effort to keep a repeat customer.

However after spending a few minutes in the store I felt cold, alienated and stupid,
For starters I was never greeted, my presence acknowledged, or even asked how my day was. The store was empty upon my arrival, and it was not until I dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledged....albeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner. 

I thought the furniture was vintage and original....apparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage. I was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellacked....and was not in display condition. 

I also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces I was interested in. Between eye rolls and deep sighs I was told of the inaccuracies in my question, yet never told if I could purchase the items or not. After being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store I was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh, an eye roll, and a rather condescending ""do you want to handle this?"". The stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me, making me feel dumb and rather small. 

It seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales, as most items are not for sale...and anything that is worthwhile is plastered with ""do not touch"" signage. Very unhospitable for a furniture store, as I usually like to sit in something before I purchase it. 

I'm not going to even go into the prices, which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious. 

Aside from the nasty staff, the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store I would say the store was acceptable. 

I'm sure this store will survive, as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters.

I asked her, for example, to ask the chef if the veggie burger was vegan, and she said,  ""I'm the owner and I know everything about the menu.""  So I asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said, ""I don't know.  Is a veggie burger vegan?""  I said, ""Some are; some aren't.""  She said, ""I don't think this is a place for you.  Don't come.""  I didn't.  And I won't ever.  

To sum up:  The owner is rude, unhelpful, unknowledgeable about food -- and to top it all off, she refuses to talk to the chef (who could easily answer food prep questions).  Two thumbs down; two thumbs way down.",review,3,9VgJTJvUyoyuUPRxGSlPhA

My excitement did not last long. The bloody Mary was so bland, it tasted like plain tomato juice with black pepper... However, this was not the worst part, that was they way my crepe tasted. I'm a lover of crepes. I learned how to make them as a child and they're my Go-To brunch indulgence. Now when you eat something that you love and you're confidant that you have healthy taste buds, you get very disappointed when your food tastes bad. Where I was hoping to find a delicious nutella and banana flavor, I was taken aback by the overwhelming taste of oil. Not delicious. 

Chefs can have an off day and food can turn, I get it. I don't get how a Server can then attempt to make a customer feel guilty or stupid if they send the plate back. I've worked in the service industry for many years and sending food back, gives the restaurant a chance to turn your experience around. If you messed up once, it's totally forgivable, however if you then give a crappy response to the customer, you're officially a sucky server. 

Bummed that I had such a poor experience at this cute little neighborhood eatery and even more bummed that I didn't get to enjoy a tasty crepe.

Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).

I walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more ""attention grabbing"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).

I don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing.

Problem 1: Hosting a political event without warning during the Saturday lunch hour.  No signs on the outside, no warning until we're in and heading for the table, and we realize, ""There's a guy, stumping for Mayor of Phoenix, and he's going to just talk the entire lunch hour.""  So this means we can either enjoy conversation with our friends or we can sit and eat quietly while an unelected politician tells us why we shouldn't trust elected politicians.

Problem 2: Very dry chicken.  Seriously, I think they stuck a frozen Wal-Mart chicken breast in the microwave and nuked it for 8 minutes or something.  How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good?  So now I get to try to choke down dry chicken and terrible political speeches at the same time.

Problem 3:  The candidate finally quits talking.  Then he takes a photo standing between the waitresses and says, ""It's like beauty on the outside, and beast on the inside.""  No one laughs.  But then the owner comes up to our table as we're finally getting the chance to talk to each other, and she spends another 15 minutes telling us why we should vote for a certain party and why she wants to move into Phoenix from her home in Fountain Hills.  My favorite line: ""We need to make it harder for folks to drive so that they start using public transportation.""  But of course, she's not using the light rail on her way in from Fountain Hills.  She just wants the people off her streets when she's trying to drive in and out of the city.

The eating section looked quaint at first: clearly the original counter with lots of interesting items wreathed around it.  But upon closer look, the counter was in disrepair, trim had fallen off in places, and shelves were missing, requiring supplies and table settings to not only be displayed, but piled in a jumble on the surviving shelves in full view of customers.  Worse, the jukebox was broken which we only found out after we already wasted 2 bits.

Service:  terrible.  The wait staff was young and in need of training.   Our waiter didn't write down our order and had to ask 3 questions because he forgot.  Then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served.  There was a large table behind us our waiter also was serving and I overheard that a child's order was completely forgotten.  Dude, just write it down!  You're not ready for a big boy server gig, it's okay.

Food:  deplorable.   Other reviews correctly assess the embarrassing ""hamburgers"", but the fountain drinks (we had the root beer float and Breakfast at Tiffany's ) were weak sauce (literally).  I had the Ruben with potato salad which was decent, but I was pretty hungry and would have eaten anything.  I would have preferred fries but they weren't in the menu, no deep fryer either ?

Overall the ambience was that of a David lynch movie spliced with ""The Road"".

I ordered a U-Box from UHaul and picked it up (and returned it for shipping) on 6/12. As per their confirmation email to me, it was GUARANTEED to arrive at it's final destination 6/22. It did not arrive until 6/26. I was informed by a local UBox representative that it would be no problem to get the UBox sent to a slightly more convenient location. I kept in touch with her for several days and she then told me she had tried to speak to the shipping department.The shipping department had told her there was no way to change the destination without calling the (undisclosed to me) third party shipping company. Then they told her they couldn't do that as they didn't have a working telephone number for the shipping company!!!!

Every call I have made to UHaul, be it a specific location, regional office, or corporate headquarters has been handed off when I ask about getting a partial refund. Every person directs me to call another office. When I was finally able to get in touch with the originating Madison, WI office, the person I spoke with (supposedly the shipping manager- Brandon Fiddler) was incredibly rude to me as said flat out ""I see it was shipped late. That's how it goes. I'm not giving you anything."" I called corporate, after speaking to this man, I was told that I apparently threatened legal action so they won't speak to me any longer and have closed my case? Seeing as how I never threatened legal action, I find this preposterous, and I challenge them to produce the recording I did so in, since they record all phone conversations. UHaul has taken moving, an already stressful experience, and made it completely miserable. I have spent more than 7 hours on the phone with them, and can't get any resolution at all, and generally, receive nothing but insolence. They love to tell you that you have to contact the originating office or the receiving office or corporate or that the people you need to speak to are all away at the moment and have wildly unpredictable hours.

In addition to all of this, I had initially rented a trailer as well, and had a hitch installed on my car. The day comes to go get my trailer and they (surprise) don't have it. They make me drive out to the middle of friggin' nowhere to get it, 5 minutes before this gas station that does UHaul on the side is closing. We do the paperwork and he's ready to connect my trailer- except the hitch is incomplete! I had to run around this tiny town trying to find the remaining parts and lucky for me this nice guy stayed late. What a complete nightmare.

Update: A very nice guy at the original location approved roughly 30% of my expenses/ demand for money back. But that only happened AFTER I filed a complaint with the BBB, which is still going back and forth. FILE A COMPLAINT WITH BBB ASAP, that is likely the ONLY way they will even pay attention to you. Also, do some googling on it, their customer service isn't the only thing they like to pass blame from office to office on. If you sue them, you have to sue the corporate office in Phoenix. They will say it's a family of franchise companies and pass the blame, but that's how the actual law behind it works, and they will lose.

Oh- in addition, in the process of researching, I found this guy's story, READ IT.

I had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. 

Shortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. 

Photos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles ""it must have vibrated off after service."" 


I may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever ""vibrated off"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really.

I lived here for 3 years under BRE and almost always loved living here. Ever since renewing with the new management, MEB, last year I've been miserable. 

I was looking to upgrade from a 1BR to a 2BR and was instantly offered a great location in the complex with promise it was fully upgraded at a specific price (by Tomas). Two days later I got a call from the front office telling me I actually could not have that apartment as they had also offered it to someone else... and they would be giving it to the other people, not me - without explanation to why. They, however promised to find me another location. 

When the new location was determined I got a call but was told I wouldn't be able to see it until 10 days prior to my move in as it was currently occupied. The manager, Pam, promised that the unit was FULLY upgraded with a fireplace and new cabinets and laminate floors.  I was nervous to wait until so close to my move date but I  still trusted the new management group as they seemed eager to keep me in the complex. HUGE mistake. 

On my tour through the unit it was a disaster. The floors were stained. There was a terrible infestation of ants. The cabinets were so old and disgusting and the entire kitchen was so filthy it actually smelled. Even Carolyn (who was showing me the unit) seemed disgusted. 

At this point my current apartment was completely packed and ready to go only to now be told there were no acceptable, livable apartments in the complex for me to move in to. I was in a tight spot - I had very little time to look for another place to live and had to be traveling for work for the next 3 weeks. I felt stuck and dependent on the management to find me another location in the complex. 

I finally received a call from Pam that another location would be available for me to view and make a decision. When I came to view it Pam pawned me off on Carolyn to show me the unit (it was more important for her to go to lunch than to diffuse an already messy situation). Carolyn pleasantly obliged. The unit, to my surprise, was much cleaner. The carpets needed to be replaced which she assured me would happen. The cabinets were not upgraded and were stained as were the counters and the rent was higher than originally discussed. We reached an agreement to bring the rent back down if I didn't make them upgrade the kitchen (as usual, I got the raw end of the deal). When I viewed the unit I pointed out the loud noise coming from the apartment above me and mentioned that I would not be able to put up with that even during the day as I often work from a home office. I was told they would notify the neighbors someone would be moving in below so they were more conscientious of their noise.

After moving in I filled out the extensive ""pre-existing problems"" sheet with items that included overly patched walls, obvious flood damage on the ceiling as well as near the sink, scratch marks in the laundry room (even though I was assured this unit was previously pet free as I am VERY allergic to animals - again I let it go as the carpets were replaced and I just did a deep clean when I moved in), stained counter, stained cabinets, stained refrigerator, stained showers, rusty washed and dirty/damaged dryer. When I turned it in they made no offer to come correct any problems (something the previous management did when I first moved in to my first unit). 

The upstairs neighbors were never quieter than the day I saw the unit and were often MUCH louder. They played loud music, they dropped cigarette butts off their balcony onto mine, they threw garbage and food over their balcony. Every time I complained I was promised action that never seemed to come. At one point, after calling security on their loud noise after 2am I heard the security guard tell them it was ""the neighbor downstairs complaining"". This began the retaliation - my assigned parking spot is located far from my unit and every time I was walking back to my door they would sit on their balcony calling me vulgar things and spitting and pouring drinks over the balcony as I walked by. I reported this to no reaction from management as well. 

 I later found out the unit above was housing 5 people although only 1 was on the lease - meaning no other adult had been background checked  for a criminal history. As a woman living alone I became more concerned. I pushed harder for them to take action and in turn manager Pam offered to ""let"" me break my lease at no charge - she tried to push me out instead of dealing with the real issue. I pointed out that is MEB wanted to break the lease they would be legally obligated to abide by their terms just the same and that they wouldn't be doing ME the favor by trying to force me to leave and pay to try and move again.

4) The staff is not friendly.

5) The room stank of cigarette smoke - it was suppose to be non-smoking. The bathrooms were nasty. And there was a wet spot on the carpet. I also found a ridiculous love letter someone had left behind... And while that was incredibly amusing, the fact that the cleaning staff had missed it spoke volumes about their attention to detail.

I may be off but 24 hour shuttle usually means you have a shuttle that goes back and forth from the airport throughout the day.  No such shuttle appeared.  Ended up cabbing it (that's another story - look for Mayflower Cab in Phoenix) an having to make an appointment for the shuttle in the morning. Upon arrival, the worker at the desk was chatting it up with some person who looked like he had nothing better to do at 11:20 pm but hang out at this ghetto ass hotel. When we interrupted their conversation, we weren't greeted, no smile, nothing. Finally get checked in and make our way up to the room. Absolute bare bones, which we paid for. At least the place seemed clean to the naked eye. Who knows what a black light would have revealed.

Upon check out, Mr. Hospitality was still working the front desk.  We were walking in just as he was walking out with the coffee thermos. He could have taken care of us first then the coffee later. Nope. Coffee more important. He comes back carrying two pitchers of juice and a tray of pastries (both hands full). He bangs the tray into the window and sneers at us as if to say, ""Open the door for me.""  We checked out quickly and were happy to get out of there. Thankfully the shuttle was there already. (Run by a third party)

Recommendation: never stay here. Ever. For any reason. Sleep in your car. Days Inn should take away their license to use the company name. I've stayed at a lot of hotels and a wide array of them. This is by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had.

We thought staying at a Days Inn would be a cheaper but still comfortable stay. Wow were we wrong.  If the strip club across the street, the homeless out front and the run down exterior were the only things wrong, we could probably still make it work. But when we got into the room, it tipped the scale. 

The room is outdated, but whatever. It was the comforter with the giant blood stain on one side and a huge hole cut into the other side that really freaked me out. The bathroom was gross with rust stains throughout the shower. The towels and washcloths were gray and stained. The sheets, when I got the courage to pull back the comforter, were stained and gray as well. No way was I ever putting my head near them. The mini fridge was covered with tape adhesive from the duct tape used to transport it. And the walls were splattered with some substance and had marks and chunks of drywall missing. Just dirty!!!

We were in the room only long enough to call other hotels to make arrangements. I couldn't even sit down in this room. 

Then the whole ordeal with the motel Manager and Priceline...I won't go into it too much but they told us we would only get one night refunded because we didn't like the fact that it was a smoking room. My husband smokes, so I have no idea what the heck kinda of story they made up. Whatever.

I will say that the benefit of location is a huge plus for Courtney Village. You are less than 10 minutes from ASU and oldtown Scottsdale. Less than 30 minutes from almost every part of the valley. 

Another benefit is their dog park. A good core group of residents frequent the dog park multiple times a week. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people and all they ask is that your dog not be a total dick. It gives the complex a greater sense of community.

Unfortunately, those are the only two benefits that Courtney Village offers. The apartment office is rude and unresponsive to resident inquiries. They advertise a ""gated"" community, but will let the gates sit broken and open for weeks at a time, giving anyone the ability to enter the complex. They promise a 48-hour maintenance work order fix, but refuse to co-ordinate their maintenance appointments with the resident's schedule. They expect you to let their maintenance guys have carte blanche access to your home without ever meeting them. They are so committed to this 48 hour time frame that if you try to call a work order in with a desired fix date more than 48 hours out, they will tell you that you need to call back closer to the desired date. 

Another issue with the office is that everyone is in ""cover your ass"" mode. Employees are quick to throw others under the bus for misinformation and also will lie to a resident at the drop of a hat. My last rent check took over four weeks to be cashed by the office. I called after two weeks to make sure my payment was applied. The office assured me that they had cashed the check and that it must be a problem with my bank. Sure enough, once my check was cashed and I looked at the deposit date, it was deposited on the 27th of the month. Maybe instead of lying to a resident, they could just admit that they fucked up instead of leading someone on a wild goose chase with their bank over outstanding checks.

The biggest problem is that Courtney Village believes they have some sort of inflated value based on their apartment's location. They will try to charge you almost $900 a month for a 2 bedroom, 1,050sq ft apartment. They do this despite having a trailer park a block to the west, being 1/4th of a mile away from a complex where two men broke into the apartment of a woman and proceeded to rape and rob her, and also 1/4th of a mile away from a National Guard base where a solider was stabbed while taking out the trash. They refuse to even hire a security guard to do nightly checks, instead relying on the two residents who are Phoenix police members to demonstrate a level of security in the complex that does not exist. Seems like the more the neighborhood goes downhill, the higher they raise their rates. They also won't give any current residents a fair shake when it comes to renewing their lease. My buddy continued to pay nearly $800 a month for the same model unit that they rented to his neighbors for $750 two weeks earlier. Seems that they would rather risk bringing in new tenants at a slightly higher price point than working with current residents. 

This review may seem negative, and in all honesty it is, but this complex is ran by a very negative group of people. They try to work you with their community bullshit, but at the end of the day they could care less if your car is broken into or if the grounds look nice or if your apartment is taken care of. They only care about that rent check being dropped in their mail on the 1st. Avoid the bullshit and find a nicer, safer, cleaner place closer to Scottsdale or ASU for the same price point.",review,2,5W-ruHmpkwLyI6LlanHstw

Quiet, working class residents, and families.  When the current mgt company took over, it started to slowly take a turn for the worse.  First thing they did was try to hassle me about my recent lease renewal before the prior company left.  Said I was paying to little.  Sorry, I signed the contract, you have to honor it......I agree with the other reviewers that stated how bad the customer relation skills of the employees in the leasing office are. (With the exception of CJ, he is very pleasant, and easy to talk to.  Unfortunately, he has no managerial power).  Less than a year ago I was on a 4month medical leave due to a kidney transplant.  My benefits were taking long to go through, so I advised the office of my situation, and wanted to work something out.  Sorry, no dice.  Since it took an extra 2 weeks to receive my funds (now I was over 10days late) they filed papers with a lawyer, and I got served.  So the money I just got, had to go to late fees, plus the lawyer fees, which were over $200 alone.  I wasn't allowed to set up a payment plan, pay half, or any other option.  Nice way to treat a long term tenant.  

They used to be so strict with issues such as picking up after your dog, parking your car properly within the lines. and noise problems.  Sadly all these things have gone.  It's almost like dodging land mines everyday.  Many of us have complained, but their HONEST to GOODNESS answer was, ""Well if we don't know who it is, we can't do anything about it.  Maybe if you took a picture of them, or told us the apt #"".......So I should hide in the bushes with a camera, or stalk the person?  I asked if they could at least put out a letter asking residents to be more mindful and respectful.  They said no.
Now I see abandoned cars with flat tires, broken headlights, and expired plates.  They used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate.  The grills have been broken (handles, burners, self igniter, etc) for well over 4 years.

Sadly, the complex has mirrored the surrounding neighborhood a great deal the past few years.  Even a lot of the residents are just rude and discourteous.  They'll park in your spot or take up both theirs and yours.  Other neighbors have complained of their cars and apartments being broken into. And yet we still have no type of security presence. 

If you're a new tenant, they are all smiles and welcome you in.  But as a current resident, their expression conveys more of a ""What do you want?"" attitude.  You try to ask a question, or ask for help with maybe dealing with problems in the common areas (like broken bbq grills), and you get a 'Yeah we know', or a 'We'll look into it'.  Nothing ever happens.  They DON'T take care about the current and long term residents.  And because of all these issues, many of the good people have left.  

This for sure is my last lease.  It can't come fast enough.  If I'm able to save up enough money, I just may break it, so I can get out.",review,1,n2BtqUzIsQv7Vw9pJc3Xow

On the surface you would automatically want to live in these apartments just off their appearance but don't be fooled because the management staff at this location is HORRIBLE and don't care whatsoever. I had an issue where maintenance was entering my  apartment because they ""thought"" I had moved out. My lease wasn't up for another month and though I had already moved most of my belongings out I still had a few items in the apartment. Well maintenance decided they would take it upon themselves and ""clean"" the apartment so it could be ready for someone else to move in, while I'm still paying rent for this apartment. In doing so they threw away the belongings I had in the apartment including clothes & towels. Not only had they entered to ""clean"" the apartment once but TWICE! After the first incident I went up to the office and they said ""oh we're not sure if someone has been in your apartment"". Huh?? So silly me I thought that there was NO WAY they would make the mistake of coming back prematurely again after I just went to complain...WRONG! They entered the apartment again without my permission the following week and again threw away my belongings. This time I went to the management office and one girl was trying to contact maintenance to get to the bottom of this. Then out of nowhere here comes the head manager not saying hi & even asking me what happened; she immediately goes on the defensive and says her guys weren't in my apartment and that I need to file a police report because apparently someone must've broken into my apartment. I proceeded to ask her who would break into an apartment lock the door afterwards and CLEAN IT UP??? After she realized she was making no sense she refused talk or help me anymore and said there was nothing they could do. The funny part is I could hear the head maintenance guy in the other lady's office saying ""yeah I went in there the other day because I thought it was vacant...but once I saw some clothes I just moved the blinds over and walked out."" So they were clearly lying to me at the leasing office to cover their own butts.

10269,bVRoCoXu2jIyqbZRT_isWw,0,2012-08-02,2,_eByl2hiDTsqOoavDz1kxg,1,"My current roommate and I recently moved into these apartments after being recommended from one of our close friends who had also recently moved in. Since none of us have ever lived here before, we did not know that the website was filled with lies and illusions. Though on the outside the complex appears cheery, the people in the office are less then subpar. hey have the customer service skills of a rock. Upon moving in, my roommate and I began to experience loud noises and fighting coming from our neighbors on the 3rd floor. The fight literally lasted from 1:00AM -5:00AM. I woke up for work (tired from the lack of sleep) and they were STILL fighting. It sounded like a girl and a guy were really having some relationship issues. I let it go and continued on to work. 

The next night  the fighting continued. Now it sounded like it was getting violent with shouts like ""YOU HIT ME FIRST,"" and ""I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE."" I could not take it anymore and decided to call the police. At 2:45AM on a Wednesday I called the police to file a noise complaint. The operator was extremely nice for the early hour and sent 2 officers out. After about 20-30 minutes I hear loud knocking on the door above me. Finally the yelling stopped and I was able to get some sleep (Thanks to Phoenix's Finest). The next night the fighting continued and so did the loud bangs and booms. When I say loud noises, I am talking about ""booms"" so loud that our windows shook in the bedrooms. It sounded like bowling balls were being thrown around...or bodies. My roommate came into my room to see if I was awake and to no surprise I was already staring at the ceiling seeing red. We decided to call the police again at around the usual 2:45AM time. This time we requested for the cop to come down to our place and report what they discussed with the inconsiderate neighbors. After dozing in and out trying to stay awake about an hour and a half later we decided that we couldnt wait for the police any longer and fell asleep. I was jolted awake when i heard a loud knock on our front door. I hopped out of bed and walked towards the front, my roommate quickly stopped me and said that was not the cop. She said that the knock did not sound like a cop's knock. Before I could look through the peep hole we then heard through the door ""OPEN UP, WE KNOW YOU CALLED THE COPS."" it was our lovely neighbors paying us a visit. Again they continued on saying ""IF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL THE COPS YOU SHOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO OPEN THE DOOR."" The knocking continued for another 7-10 minutes and progressively became louder and louder. We then heard one of the guys run  up and down the stairs screaming and banging on other tenants doors in a fit of rage that the police were called on them. My roommate and I never went back to sleep and drove around from 6:00AM-9:00AM to wait for the office to open. When the office opened we went in to let them know about the insane madness that went on during the night. Let's not forget I had to call out of work and miss out on an opportunity to make money. The office could care less and did absolutely nothing. With the exception of one employee, CJ, the office employees have no sense of how to treat a person. The manager, Lisa,  was the worst of all. She spoke over me, made me seem like i was blowing things out of proportion and when I stated how upset it made me feel she followed by stating ""we have all gone through difficult things in our life."" 

Currently as it stands my roommate and I have been here for about 4 months and are still dealing with the horrible neighbors. I have been called a ""bitch"" by one of them while walking to my car, the noise will not stop and is still causing us sleepless nights, our complaints are left unheard and unnoticed, it is flat out miserable. The 2 of the neighbors have moved out but now the one left has his friends staying with him and they make more noise then ever. Our place is absolutely miserable. Our door is constantly being knocked on and just tonight the neighbors jiggled the handle while we were sitting in the living room watching TV. We have become a joke to them because they know the office will not do anything. they could care less about the people who live here and I have never lived in a place that was so disrespectful to their tenants. We have gone to everyone working in there and they all act like their hands are tied. It's pathetic. The last person I spoke with today stated that if we wait a week ""things should work out themselves."" when i asked for the number to the customer relations to file a complaint, she basically told me that it would not do any good and refused to give it to me. 

Whatever you do DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! It is not worth it. They make you sign a 15 month lease and trap you in with unpleasant people both in the office and living around you.

The staff appeared to be friendly and helpful until I actually moved in! Shortly after I moved in we had an ant problem in the first week. I went to the office so I could be put on the pest control list and the ants never went away so I had to buy my own bug spray and fix the problem.
Then about a month into being moved in the lock on my front door came completely out. When my bf told the office that our lock was broken and we both had work that day the lady told him someone should be there to fix it within the next hour. When I went on my break 4 hours later I called the office to make sure my house was locked and they told me no one had been there yet. Finally someone got there but they installed the new lock wrong and it's always a hassle to lock or unlock my door now. 
  A few months after this I went to get a direct tv installment paper signed by the office and the First Lady I spoke with I could barely understand and she seemed to not know what she was doing. Then the property manager came out after I asked the First Lady if I could speak with her and she wouldn't go get her for me, and the manager was extremely rude about the situation with me. 
Also my laundry room closet door fell off the tracks completely one day and almost fell on my head. There are also a lot minor reports that weren't made before I moved in. 
 Lastly this week my boyfriend got his car out of the shop after 5 months and the tags he had were expired the day after we brought the car home the management put a tow away sticker on his car even though it was parked in an uncovered parking space and was doing nothing to anyone.

If you are considering living at Courtney Village, please do yourself an enormous favor and RUN immediately! This is by far the worst place I have ever lived. First and foremost, get ready to be constantly hit with random fees. Your monthly rent will NEVER be the same. You have a base rent, but they pile on the fees constantly every month. Secondly, majority of the maintenance staff are extremely rude. I got yelled at because my dog pooped in the dog park and I didn't immediately run over and pick it up. I had every intention of picking it up, I just wasn't aware I would be scolded for not catching it as it fell out of his ass. Also, one time my roommate was on vacation for the weekend and had locked her bedroom door (which was the master bedroom with the other restroom inside) my toilet handle broke, so I called maintenance. They told me that because I had another restroom in my apartment, even though I had mentioned I didn't have access to it, that it wasn't classified as an ""emergency"" and they wouldn't send anyone until Monday. This happened first thing when I woke up on Saturday. So I had to walk to the public bathroom by the pool all weekend just to use the restroom. Speaking of the pool, if you live on the south side apartments, the pool isn't heated and there is no hot tub, so get ready to rarely or never use the pool. Also, the waterfall feature hasn't worked for about 6 months. At one point it must have been something with the pump that was going out because it was so loud constantly I was worried it was going to explode and kill us all (wishful thinking?!). Another negative, it is in the ghetto. During the 14 month lease I was there for, there was a domestic shooting, a police helicopter hovered over the complex and shined the spotlight in all of the hallways and windows for a good 15 minutes, constant parking lot arguments, as well as parking lot sexual favors, multiple shootings in the area, car break ins, and my personal favorite was when my boyfriend and I were walking in the parking lot and a cop pulled up and asked him very sternly if his name was Clinton (he's not Clinton). I have never felt more unsafe in my life. My boyfriend wouldn't let me take my dog outside alone after dark. If I could go back 14 months ago, I would run for the hills screaming.

More than that, it was simply not good. I'm not sure if the food was just old and done for the day, as we were there about an hour before closing time, or what, but the meat was basically sprayed with some sauce and they called it a day. The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked. I had chicken but the ribs were absolutely nothing to sneeze at either. The corn on the cob was simply some frozen piece nuked up or boiled or what-have-you, with some chips thrown in for good measure and that was about it.

The insides aren't impressive in the slightest, either. I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it (Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind, as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside) but this was dark, dingy, and unpleasant.

The sauce was perhaps a saving grace if the food wasn't served nearly lukewarm and was able to bring something to the table on its own. Sadly, no amount of sauce-drowning could save my meal. I left unhappy and unfulfilled. I've heard so many great things from people I trust, so I may have to try it once more, during the day, but for now, the one star stands, as there was simply nothing even a little redeeming about this food.",review,0,8-2W5CmkDl9vrkxRpkiPRg

During lunch hours it can be hard to find a parking slot at Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q restaurant. There are probably 20 spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly. From the outside, Honey Bear's looks as if it has had it's share of violence and has survived through it all. Fortunately enough, the inside makes up for the outside, but only in part. The restaurant is clean and the food appears to be prepared in a clean environment. But the whole building and the front part sure could do with a fresh coat of paint. That whole part of Phoenix is pretty runned down anyways. Honey Bear's is probably the best kept of its neighbors. Even so, don't attempt to gamble with your life and walk from work to the restaurant, you might get stabbed or shot at or both -- you've been warned.

Many people in our office love Honey Bear's and if they had the chance would go and eat there every day. Out of the three times I've been to Honey Bear's during two of them I've gotten a BBQ sandwich and the other time I got a salad. The salad was nothing to write home about and honestly I didn't expect it to be. The place specializes in Tennessee style BBQ and not in salads. So if BBQ doesn't turn you on, then neither will Honey Bear's. The BBQ sandwiches at Honey Bear's never seem to impress me though. It just reminds me of sloppy joe and honestly I'd rather have a sandwich made with Manwich than with their BBQ chicken. Manwich is at the very least ""managable"". The meat on the sandwichs at Honey Bear's seem to be all over the place. It is uncontrollable almost. Their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it. If you try, it is just a mess. You end up having to eat your sandwich with a fork. Com'on now, is that how the people in Tennesee eat their sandwiches? With a fork? Yea, it's true what their moto says, ""You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!"", but I can guarantee you, you'll need a fork.

As for food presentation, Honey Bear's doesn't do so well. Their sandwiches come wrapped in tin foil and the first impression you get is that there was no care put into it when they made it. They just plopted the meat on and moved on to the next customer.

I have heard through various channels that Honey Bears tastes like cafateria food. Atleast I'm not the only hater.

The price for food at Honey Bear's is about $5 just for the sandwich alone. With a drink and a side order of something it will usually run you about $8. The whole menu is pretty much a-la-carte.

We will probably visit Honey Bear's agian because my co-workers have a thing for BBQ. But honestly, I think that Honey Bear's reputation is far better than their food and food presentation.",review,1,VNEqps27mp8-gTqTfzg7yw

So I offered to pick it up, when I arrived at the Van Buren location, I had to wait 30 minutes for the order which was still way beyond the quoted time. I was also told at the cash register that they ""were out of peach cobbler that day"" so none of my guests received dessert - which may have not been a big deal except for the fact that it was a retirement party.

The establishment is a hole in the wall, butsome of the best BBQ I have ever had was in holes in the wall (i.e. Aurthur Bryant's in Kansas City). We got out of the car and were greeted by the pleasant smell of wood smoking meat, and it smelled awesome. I was super excited...until we stepped into the door.

The aroma went from pecan wood chips to backed up sewage. I kid you not it smelled like someone emptied their bowels in the middle of the lobby. People would come in and turn right back around and leave. But, my friend assured me this was the place to be so darn it, I was going to stick it out.

I got the BBQ chicken sandwich. The sauce had very little flavor to it but the meat was tender (there is your one star, the ability to not dry out chicken). I asked about what side the cashier would prefer and she just shrugged and said ""I guess the potato salad."" As expected from the response, it was mediocre.

The animals always huddled towards the back of the areas making them completely unviewable.  I guess it was a zoo of Rocks n Sticks.

It was so very sad to see so many tired looking, bored out their gourd, animals (they looked elderly) subjected to equally tired old surroundings. Many of the animal facilities were closed barring viewing of the animals at all. Display plaques educating the touring viewer were damaged. Often, audio push-button materials were broken. Staff and caretakers seemed to have no charisma or enthusiasm. Everything and everyone seemed quite jaded. The entire facility seemed to seethe of ways to further separate the visiting guest from the contents of his/her wallet with countless inflationary concession stands, gift shop memorabilia, carnival type rides. They were sickeningly blatant and expensive. The up side? It was a beautiful day with plentiful sunshine and little to no discernable air pollution. From now on I think I'll go to the zoo off Northern Ave. Though I understand it is much more expensive for admission, I just can't justify patronizing the Phoenix Zoo in its current state.",review,1,YPKyc9Hv3-b8v6GlagEplA

I would not even pay them $5.00 to get in this place in fact they would have to pay me to go back there because this is not a zoo but a big joke at our expense! I gave them one star for zoo lights.

We had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named Zach.  We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said ""you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat."" We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again raised his voice and people started to stare...he said ""you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.""  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue, why not tell people when they get in the boat?  So ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $5.  They even had devised a ""hand signal"" so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us.  The most curious thing to us was why didn't they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat?  They never mentioned it to us.  It seriously ruined our trip.

I'm an Arizona-born-native and I've been to the Zoo and the Zoolights over SEVERAL decades.  I've been bored out of my skull every time.  As an adult, I've attended these events with the youngsters because they somehow believe it's cool.  If you're looking to score husband-points, then, by all means, drag everyone there.  Your feet and legs will be sore from all the walking they make you do.  If you're looking for enjoyment, DO NOT BOTHER.  The sneaky and insidious problem is that this place is EXTREMELY expensive, and pretends that they are providing a service to the community.  Let me explain---  they truly believe that they are a worth-while value for every family dollar you're spending.  Yet, don't believe a salesman--- they wiil bend the truth every time, and smile at you while they take your dollar.  And now, on the the Big Three:

1)  Price:  This is the absolute worst problem with this seemingly, family-friendly place.  I mean, who would think that a City Zoo would be trying to scalp you for cash?  Let me give you an example of a small family of 4... this can EASILY turn into a $100 day.  For a 6-8 person group of working-class families, this can easily reach over $150, and outside of a $50,000/yr income household.  If your kids bring friends, it will be even more.  You'll hear cashiers say that ""their Zoo"" is worthy of their out-of-reach-for-the-common-man pricing.  Their answer is simply rhetoric, because, when pressed, they won't be able to explain why the price is this high for a family.  

The bottom line is that, their prices are so incredibly high, that Joe-average, and his family, cannot afford to visit this local zoo without budgeting for it over a couple of months.  Maybe we should've left our fixed-income Grandma and Grandpa at home, although that didn't seem right. 

2)  Service:  Everyone we met was attentive and receptive.  They seemed to genuinely want you to have a good time.  

3)  Taste:  Everything we tried was tasty, although it was hard to enjoy because everything is 3 times the price that it should be.  

In Summation:  I'm not sure why this place is recommended by any kind of governmental body, as to why this is a benefit to the State of Arizona, unless they are making some kind of profit from it.  NO, WAIT, ---- they tax every transaction within the Zoo's control.

Skip this next portion if you're married with kids.  This section is addressed to some Weinee that complained about my comments where I said the $18 entrance fee was too high... 

     -----Since you're single, probably going double-dutch, it's no wonder why you'll be shocked by what I've said, because, ""...dude, it's only $18...."".  That's when everyone else knows that you are alone and have no family responsibilities.  While I might envy your ease-of-movement-as-a-single-guy, please gauge your speculation on the # of your children and the # of your extended family.  For example:  5 kids, plus their total of 11 friends, plus 3 grandparents, for tickets to get in.  Include food/drink while you're there, and I don't even have a big family.  At those rates, I'm sure you'll agree, that this place is monetarily ANTI-FAMILY and prohibitively EXPENSIVE.  No, wait....  LET'S GO EVERY WEEKEND, BECAUSE I'M SINGLE ON A DOUBLE-DUTCH DATE!!!

You are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. 
My mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.
We got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)
When I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.
(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; ""maybe you should learn how to say no."" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said ""Maybe you should mind your own business."" Then I turned around again and heard; ""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick."" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said ""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.""
He looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said ""No."" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. 
I explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!
I've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said ""you don't have to explain that to me..."" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said ""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. ""
When I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???
So I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.
I was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.

Had my Kindle STOLEN from their mailroom.  Amazon replaced it, but the office initially wasn't helpful in trying to find it, or admitting that it was even their fault.  In fact the property manager got snarky with me and stated they are not responsible for any lost or stolen mail.  Gee thanks, so I guess that means you can't help me look for it either.  As proof I offered up the fact that UPS had a signature on file for the delivery from the office manager.  I even called and talked to the guy who delivered it and he remembered dropping it off b/c it was one of those black Kindle boxes.  

After all was said and done they said they'd leave the door to the mail room close and lock it.  I went in this past weekend, saw the mail room door wide open with not a person in sight.  Again, it's impressive how incompetent these people are.

Initial review August 2013

They can't get their act together.  Moved in in May and there were many issues with the apartment (dishwasher had rusty wracks, ice maker didn't work, carpets were not properly cleaned, dryer timer didn't work, the disposal was broken, the garage door open was broken, etc.).  It took several rounds of complaining to even get them to come out and look and even more rounds of follow up to get them to complete it.  It's September and the ice maker is STILL broken.  It's incredible how terrible they are!  I am actually astounded they could be this bad at their jobs.  I am ticked off enough that I logged on to write a bad review and I am typically a very understand and sympathetic person, but this is ridiculous.  We were also welcomed to a nice ANT problem the day we moved in.  I had called several weeks before we moved in and asked them to spray for critters.  Obviously that never happened either.

I also didn't appreciate the fact that they list GARAGE space in their square footage stats.  Something they LIED (intentionally or no, they should know what the square footage is in their units... that makes them either liars or incompetent and you should not tolerate either) about to my wife before we leased it and didn't discover until after it was too late (I had to move in sight unseen because we relocated from across the country and my wife was the only one who could see it in person at the time).

I've also had to call the cops for a domestic disturbance for someone in the complex... you can't always help or predict that, but it's the first time I've ever had to do that and I lived in downtown Chicago for 6 years before I moved here.

My advice, spend your hard earned money elsewhere, this place is laughably terrible.",review,0,VCtZgkAtlXIkMYM8olySQw

Before I moved in the complex was managed by Greystar then switched over to Alliance. The morning I was scheduled to move in, the people working the front office had no idea what keys to give me and after I told them I had to leave to meet the movers they agreed to give them to my brother- which they did but without checking his ID to make sure he was the person they were supposed to give them to. 

The complex grounds and the surrounding areas where people walk their dogs always has dog feces and there seems to be a shortage of doggy bags the majority of the week. The security gates stay broken like they have given up on trying to fix them. The drive in gates and clickers are questionable as to when they they work- the last months of my lease after trying to get a clicker that worked from the main office several times, I gave up on having a functioning one. The complex itself has a high turn over with people leaving in the middle of the night- there would be drunk people who don't live at the complex hanging out by the pool mooching off residents- police rolled through on more then one occasion- weekends were debatable on if you would be woken up at 3 am by people vomiting in their driveway- questionable as to if there are any background checks that got one on potential residents. 

They say they are pet friendly but only in the sense they use it to charge you as much as possible. Make sure you don't have ANY stain of any type on your carpet because if you do they will replace all the carpet in the unit on your expense at move out. At inspection, I was told the carpet in the guest bedroom would be replaced but ended up getting a bill for ALL the carpet in the unit. If you can have someone with you during your walk through, do it- that way you'll have a witness who can support you if they try to charge you for stuff other than what they told you during the inspection.

Make sure you know your lease- I had signed a short lease and upon verifying my move out date, discovered they had me down for a lease almost 6 months longer then what I signed up for. Also be aware that they will jack up your rent when it comes to renewing- I knew many people that left because they could no longer afford the constant increases. 

The place I live at now is managed by Greystar and I can tell the difference. My new place is much bigger then Palazzo but the grounds are well kept, little noise, there is a constant presence of maintenance staff and the management team, I pay less for rent and enjoy little things like secure property gates, a mail box that you can actually drop mail off in, and staff that follows up and follows through.

I was sharing a room with two other female colleagues and were appalled at the service we received during our stay. We were already upset with being relocated from the Renaissance Downtown Hotel a few days prior to attending the conference and the awful customer service provided by the hotel added to our negative overall experience with the Marriott franchise. 

Early Tuesday morning, two men came pounding at our door at 2 a.m. They identified themselves as a security guard and a worker at the hotel. They stated that this was our second warning and demanded that we open the door. This was quite alarming being that we never received a first warning for anything and were sincerely concerned about our safety. 

When we called the front desk to inquire if the two men standing outside were part of the staff of the hotel and to explain to guest services that we should have received a phone call from guest services in the first place, a guest relations worker by the name of Caroline asked us if we planned to continue with the noise level and responded with an unwarranted attitude that there was laughter heard from our room and someone in the room next to us called to complain. We were taken aback by her attitude because while we would have been more than happy to bring our noise level down, we did not expect a representative from guest services to be the one to talk back or respond to us in a matter that was rude and unnecessary when all we wanted to do was to explain to her about our concerns because we did not feel safe. We were extremely alarmed by the way the hotel handled the situation because we felt like our privacy was violated and our safety was jeopardized by these two strangers demanding us to open the door at 2 a.m. To make matters worse, when we brought this issue to the attention of the Front Office Manager, Camille Cobos, she simply made no effort to be apologetic or explain to us why this situation occurred. She simply brushed off our concerns and nonchalantly thanked us for bringing the matter to her attention.

Our office and many of the administrators and faculty at our work frequently travel to various locations across the United States in our line of work. We often choose the Marriott as a top hotel choice for our stay. However, this awful experience at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel has made us question the quality of customer service their staff provides to their clientele.  Several of my colleagues also expressed other concerns regarding their stay at this particular Marriott as well. We wrote a letter to the Marriott corporation as well as to the hotel and we have they can take this important matter into consideration and provide positive experiences for current and future Marriott guests as we would not want them to have the same experience as we did. There has not been a response from any Marriott representatives so far since we sent in the letter early March.",review,1,1F6FEZGH5kwoXn3-BrhyPA

He also wrote in the letter:

""It is our objective to provide each and ever guest a comfortable stay with utmost respect and privacy. Your comments play a critical role in our success and progress. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention. Based on you comments, I have shared my concerns with the staff and emphasized review of our training and procedures.

When we read that letter, we just looked at each other like that was just BS and were not satisfied by the half ass letter we received from the General Manager.

The guest relations worker did not show us RESPECT when she was talking back at us and asking if we planned to make any more noise after I expressed my concern about her sending strange men up to our room w/out any warning or notice to bring down the noise level (which there weren't any, we were just talking in our room. 

There were no music on, no tv on, no blow dryer on, we were just talking our normal tones but I don't know if the walls are just SUPER thin or what but regardless, we should have received a phone call from them in the first place.). For her to say ""So you plan to make more noise next time?"" I wanted to be like ""No B****, I'm not! Stop being so fresh with me because I wasn't even trying to say that!! I was just bringing up my concern that there were two large men standing outside telling us it is our second warning and to OPEN the door when we haven't even received the FIRST warning in the first place!! Now, THAT is wrong and that is a violation of our PRIVACY!! Additionally, my friend told me that when we got into the hotel room, she noticed that those two men .. the SAME men that asked us to open the door, were checking us out at the hotel lobby. They were looking at us up and down which creeped out my friend. Since, we have 3 young ladies staying in the room, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE OPEN THE DOOR to TWO STRANGERS who were checking us out and Open the door for them?! We aren't even sure if they are hotel security. But regardless, the hotel did not make us feel SAFE or COMFORTABLE at all and again, me and my colleagues are extremely disappointed in how the management has handled our concerns.

Basically, the letter that was sent to us was BS BS BS! Our company will never stay at their hotel again and I will make sure to spread the word to all our friends and family because when I do inform them about our horrible experience, they are absolutely appalled that the hotel made no efforts in making up the experience for us in any way. The ""thank you for bringing this up to our attention"" is BS to us and we will make sure that everyone who is looking for a hotel in Phoenix will never come to this establishment again. 

Thank you for letter but we would rather give our business to another hotel that actually cares about their reputation and their guests!",review,2,1F6FEZGH5kwoXn3-BrhyPA

So we've lived here for the better part of a year now and since day one we have seen these little yellow roaches everywhere that seemed to come out at night, they were EVERYWHERE! We don't have much food in the house and its all kept in the fridge to keep it from all the bugs. They come from the unsealed cabinets and every drain in the house. I even see them in the dishwasher climbing all over the dishes all the time. Dishes pulled from the cabinets often had bug crap on them. I don't know how many times I woken up to bugs crawling around, flicked them off my newborn son or woken up to them in my shirt.  We literally kill anywhere from 15-40 roaches in a single night every single night. When we go to the office they always off put it onto other people and though we see the spray truck here regularly but never visiting out unit, only those near the office.The last 5 months or so seem to have brought some new beetle things to the apartment. Twice I've moved stacks of papers for work and tons of baby beetles fleeing from them. And for the record we are immaculate in our place. Theres never a mess or uncleaned surface. 

The grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area. The gates here have worked for more than a week at most at one time. They actually haven't closed in months, last time they were fixed it was for just part of the day.  The garbage piles up around all the garbage cans for days. You will find bags lying everywhere including taking up car spaces which are not always easy to come by. 

The water in the apartments get turned off randomly without any warning. Its happened a few times during our stay here but the last time the grounds were flooded so I could see it wasn't planned. 

The air conditioning unit in here drips a lot and my family and I have had bad respiratory issues the last 6 months and come to find out the AC was pumping out mold spores that we were breathing for months. The thing hadn't even had the air filter in it all this time either. All those times we thought it was severe allergies or that we stayed awake all night coughing was poor building maintenance. My infant son often gets fevers of up to 104 that seem to spike when all of our symptoms get going. Needless to say we are breaking our lease and moving. I will not pay a company to let me rent a bug infested mold box that jeopardizes the health of my family. 

Your neighbors will break the rules in the lease agreement at every turn. They invite parties of several people to the pool and blast music all day (and night) long.

Generally I would say I have been pleased with living here but the longer I have stayed the more learn and the more I want to move out. 

Things I learned after moving in or since: the store owner of the internal 'market' was murdered a couple years back by a tenant.  Within he last year a female tentant was raped mid-day by two indivuals, two different instances of tenants dying from drug overdose, 11 first floor apartments were broken into in a month and had their flat screen tv stolen

A friend of mine had his computer stolen from his car while parked right in front of a security camera. The front office has not been helpful or concerned about this. Their initial response was that 15 new residents were moving in and they would not get to the tapes... a couple days later they stated corporate would have to review the tapes. It has now been almost three weeks and they still have not contacted me regarding any of this.. I realize theft is a problem every where.. but they clearly don't care about my concerns. 

Other (Non-safety) issues: 

Pool maintenance.. The pool near my unit was shutdown by the city for the majority of the year last year. All winter the pool was shut down the the point ducks moved in..then in the peak of pool season they finally drained it to re-tile and make repairs.. but the time it was open again pool season was nearly over. Other pools are frequently dirty, without operable chairs, or the key to enter has been changed. 

Lights: Many of the lights around the complex are burned out or broken.. The light by my unit is out, it was replaced a couple months back and burned out almost immediately.. I am specifically not calling to report it to see how long it takes for a repair. 

Cleanliness: Many of the tenants, (myself included) have dogs. There have been periods of time where everywhere I look there seems to be dog poop and all the bags to pick it up are gone. I have also noticed a lot of the tenants toss chicken bones into the grass and bushed around the grills. I have seen trash/dead birds/grass clippings/vomitt left for days at a time.

I'm usually like those of you who get too lazy to complain even if there's something wrong and usually there's not much that bothers you. However, this was my first car I bought with my hard-earned money and I wanted this to be a special event. I bought it last week but it was raining all last week so I waited and waited until today. So I scoured through my fellow Yelpers to help me pick a car wash that has great reviews. My eyes locked on World Class Car Wash and I spared no expense. I purchased the full detail $49 and Hand Wax $20. 

I told them that the previous owner had window stickers and decal everywhere. I told them about something he stuck on the dashboard and a residue that remained. I pointed them all out and I thought with paying $70 total for everything I would get some attention on things I specifically asked about. However, much to my dismay, the stickers and decal remained. I asked them to remove it and I thought it was good. Even up until then, I wanted to be happy so I just left. As I was driving my car I noticed gunk all over the window. The guy who was scraping with the razor to get the decals and stickers off didn't bother to throw decal residue out after scraping them. Everything remained. As I checked more later, I noticed candy wrappers from the previous owner still there but this time soaked breadcrumbs from being watered during the detailing process. It was nasty digging my hands down there to collect all the wrappers. 

I was very disappointed. This was my first car and I wanted it to be an experience. Sorry guys.",review,0,aTlpQ1vqSDWDmLqbMjw8tA

I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. 

At first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served.

We ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant.

OK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. 

Meanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... ""maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see"" we said to each other ... 

On our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - ""pigs stomach with jalapeno"", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?

Three hours is not too long to wait if the lobby had been full but there were only about 3 others waiting with me and what seemed like an army of employees.  I was in the actual exam room for what seemed like 2.5 hours.  They were ""kind"" enough to give me a blanket which looked like someone had vomited all over it and then it dried to a crusty finish.

here is the deal... we live not far from here, so me first, went a few years ago, so this isn't want this is about.

husband went about a year ago.  he injured himself.  gave him an Rx for advil and was sent on his way.  (Turns out, he actually had a torn muscle, and needed extensive PT and was in so much pain, etc...)

This morning is when it all comes to a head...  my daughter had this ""pimple' on her chin that felt like someone punched her in the jaw she said.  So i looked at it, thought it might be an ingrown hair so i did 'surgery' on it... for lack of a better phrase.  used tweezers, a sanitized stick pin and got the 'ingrown hair"" out (although did not find a hair)...  

So my daughter wakes up this morning, her whole chin is swollen.  She is a Navy Veteran, served in war and everything.  She is NOT a complainer.   The doc came in and didn't even look at her for more than 2 minutes.  It was a female doc and didn't introduce herself.  Did not put gloves on and examine it, just basically looked at her, and gave her an Rx for antibiotics told her to not squeeze it and said that if it wasn't better in a couple of days to go to the E.R..  Say whaa??  

as the day goes on, my daughters face becomes more and more swollen.  More and more red, just doesn't look right....   i said, ""honey, I need to look at that""  i barely put any pressure on that, and a bunch of green puss (yes tmi) comes out.  it did not take much pressure for me to get a bunch of infection out.   i contacted a friend who is a PAC...  She said I did the right thing and that daughter needs to see a doc soon and keep taking the antibitoics.  So that is what we are doing, she is making an appointment at the VA and will continue to take the antibiotics as prescribed.

This actually looks like some sort of bite!  i am outraged at this place for not inspecting this further!  This young woman is NOT a complainer, and deserved an exam.  i mean I just barely touched it and stuff came oozing out!  wtf is that?  shouldn't the DOCTOR have done that?  

so after my experience, my husbands experience, and no my daughters experience...  we will drive further to get quality care!

Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour. We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas). I've been to this location maybe 8 times. Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied. The food is cold or tastes old. The drinks are always watered down.

The last time we went was a few weeks ago. My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day. We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.

I ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. 

Finally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.

The waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me.

It was my Aunt's birthday and she _loves_ Macayo's. I went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying.

As a Phoenix native, I've known Macayo's on Central for decades. Its unique facade emulates the style of some grand Guatemalan Mayan temple, but... no, not really. And what is it that you want when you see pictures of Machu Picchu or of Tikal? You want to climb the steps, to _go in_. In the case of Macayo's, you must resist this urge with all your might.

The main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the Egyptian style. A post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within. Um. Except this article is about _food_, not a history of architecture lecture! Bleh.

As is my custom I order a cheese crisp straight off; I'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened, impervious-to-rot corn chips (see pic) just repel me. After the pushy (more on that later) waitress scurries off I notice my fork (see the picture) and realize that with the caked-on food, this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff, namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. The waitress returns and I ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch. A few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she cannot read the list. I'm not joking when I say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph. Chemical after chemical, non-food food after non-food food. And then there right in the middle is corn starch, corn meal, corn flour and corn syrup. In FLOUR tortillas! 

I immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth. ""Was the water bad too?"" I wondered.

I'm not sure where it started, but Tex-Mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa. Macayo's sets the standard. It seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show. The salsa was gloopy (again with the pic) and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat, but I doubt it. My sensible companion said it didn't taste fresh at all.

The birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late. After 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway. We decided to order, except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her. Um, whoa! Is this really happening to me? I must be in some kind of Mayan burial temple, I'm dead, and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and I'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Yes, I loved the Mummy movies.

But back to our pushy waitress. After the family tried over and over, unsuccessfully, to cajole me into ordering something, anything, we waited for the results. You'll have to see the pictures.

You know you're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item's description has to change languages from English in order to accurately describe its content. The average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you can't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item? The steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce (see pic). Those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce. Think nacho cheesy, oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring. Disgusting.

My brother ordered a taco plate (see pic) and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth. This item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer. Envision eating crab but with the shell still on it. He gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork, snail style. 

Macayo's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas, namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think Phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys. Let them fantasize about questing to Phoenix and entering the secret Mayan temple to discover the secrets within.

The reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember.

Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?

FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.

Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.

--cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture;
--salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar;
--special ""top shelf"" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead;
--rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!;
--refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered.
--chicken ""guisado"" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it;
--flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment;
--sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!

My wife and a few friends decided to grab some happy hour food and beverages somewhere. when we arrived and sat down we asked about specials, the waiter replys with ""oh,  um.... $3 draft and wells"". we proceed to ask about food and margarita specials (that the sign behind us clearly states). he tells us ""no"". I then ask him ""Are you Sure? Because that sign over there says differently"". He then says ""i'll check"". 

I was right.

After we order a drink we decided on some food. About 
15 minutes after we order a group of about 12 or 13 business type people walked in......Well i'm not really sure what happen after this point but everything seemed to go down hill really fast. 

Ok..... so i then ask the bartender to change the tv station from CBS News to the football game. (we are the only ones in there besides a person at the bar and the business types in the other room). He does this about 20 minutes after i asked as he obviously forgot until he saw me staring at him. Not too big of a deal.

25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food. He finally comes over to our table and says ""you're food will be out shortly, our cooks are slacking"" It's completely obvious to us that this guy forgot to put in our order. 

Finally our food arrives! It was brought out by another gentlemen who exclaimed ""Sorry about the wait folks, that big party over there (the business types) caught our cooks by suprise! 

1. We ordered long before they even came in. 
2. Your cooks got caught by surprise??!!!  So, they're not used to cooking when they go to work as a cook!

They got one order completely wrong. our friend who is a vegetarian, ordered the harvest sampler (the veggie sampler). They brought her the regular sampler consisting of beef chimi's burro's and other things. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for her food. 

After comping her meal we received our check. We asked the waiter again if he can split it up 3 ways (we had told him we would be doing this prior to ordering) ""Sure, No problem he says"". He returns 10 mins later only to tell us he can't split the check and we'll have to ""figure it out"" 

 My wife and the rest of our party except one, proceed to leave and wait for us outside while we ""figure out"" the check.  After deciding we would leave a poor and undeserved tip just to be nice, our waiter brings back our change.. no $1's. before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone. 

At this point i'm tempted to walk out without leaving a tip but im a nice guy. So i stroll up to the bar to make change. The new bartender makes eye contact with me,  but doesn't say a word, turns around and proceeds to shuffle around the bar as he tries desperately to open a bottle of seagrams with no luck.

I ordered and purchased the flowers and made sure that they would be able to be delivered by Feb. 14th Valentine's day.

""I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. 

Anyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, ""Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city"". 

Sadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. 

This woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over ""needy"" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. 

Despite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity.""",review,2,LSf-IajkL99JQBZ3PzXnjQ

I have been coming to this AJ's for a couple years but unfortunately I will not be returning. When I first started shopping here it was a pleasant experience but over time the customer service got worse. I am not sure if this was due to new employees or management. Although, I must blame management because the attitudes and treatment that I received usually travels from the top down. I had the most issues with a couple employees that work in the deli area. They were both always rude, short, and unpleasant. Every time I said hello to one of the women she NEVER responded. Not so much as a head nod to acknowledge my presence. I brought this to the attention of a cashier and she told me that she would speak to the manager about the service. I continued to go to AJ's but nothing changed and I received bad service over and over again. The last straw for me happened last week. I went to the deli area to get breakfast. I greeted one of the deli workers and she AGAIN said nothing. I was sure that this was on purpose and not her just having a bad day because it had happened so many times before. I asked her why she never responds and seems to have bad customer service. She dismissed me and said ""actually, I was just about to ask you how you day was going"" I thought this was amusing considering she just neglected to respond to my greeting... I told her that she had done this on a number of occasions and it was quite frankly rude and disappointing. She then jumps to want me to get my manager... Like she could care less about fixing the situation for the customer, apologizing, or making things right. 

Super disappointed with my treatment at the AJ's. Will stay away from here from now on and I would definitely NOT recommend anyone else to shop here. A number of employees could care less about you, your hard earned money, or treating with respect and dignity. Management obviously doesn't follow up with complaints properly as well.",review,3,Dpi50FrVtvy8Sh7TVbwetg

The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. 

Having lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the ""taste of England"" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. 

I guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). 

P.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did.

Basically if this is what FedEx Office wants to be known as, a homeless shelter, than fine.

Unfortunately, Bikram's Yoga College of India in Central Phoenix was one of the worst classes and studios I've ever experienced. 

The smell of the studio was so absolutely disgusting (dirty, wet dog combined with urine) that I nearly lost it when I walked in. I opted to stay because I really wanted to get a class in. On top of the awful stench, the teacher sucked. She had us hold poses longer  the second time through and shorter the first time. Many of the students had really poor technique (I know, you shouldn't worry about others...it's your own practice), however, I thought it was an indication about the poor quality of instruction.

It's unfortunate the hygiene wasn't up to par. It's bad for bikram and damn, it's really inconvenient for me. I travel to PHX a lot and I love to grab a class. Well, I'm going to try out one of the other studios in town.

I recently moved to the Phoenix area from California and have been searching for a good yoga studio. I LOVE Groupon and was happy to see several studios I can try out before I purchase a membership.  I have been practicing yoga for several years and have never been so offended during my yoga practice. While I understand that there is a particular flow for Hatha/Bikram yoga (which I prefer Vinyasa Flow), I always try to push myself a little farther with what I have learned in my previous practices at different studios. In the middle of class, I attempted a slightly different pose from what was being taught (without interrupting my fellow yogi's) and the teacher called me out in the middle of class saying ""Can you please do the same pose as the rest of the class?"" (in a derogatory tone) I was absolutely offended by his gesture so I rolled up my mat and walked right out of the class. I sincerely apologize to the other yogi's there for walking out in the middle of class and interrupting their practice but he could have been a bit more tactful with his approach. Perhaps pulling me aside after class and letting me know this was not okay with him would have been more appropriate. So rude! Perhaps it was rude of me to assume I can try and progress my yoga style during his class but I always had encouragment from my previous teachers for pushing myself to evolve in my practice.

In addition, because of the Groupon, the class was extremely packed and there was no room to move or do the poses correctly.  Also, the studio has carpet (which is different than what I am used to) and it is really disgusting! Sweaty, dirty, nasty and probably filled with bacteria. eew!

To have it packed and shipped to Massachussettes was $103. I had very clear instructions to ship the item from the UPS store, using USPS. I had given the clerk my cell phone to copy the address from which she did and everything should have been fine.
Exactly one month later I go to ship just a framed print (same size as the first one). This time I was being charge $118? I asked why this one was costing more than the original shipment which was heavier. I explained what I had shipped previously when the man suddenly remembered that THE PRINT AND CEMENT ITEM I HAD SENT A MONTH AGO WERE STILL THERE! I was told that the address was undeliverable via UPS. We checked the address verified it was correct. I was told they had tried calling me once. They tried calling a number that I never gave them. A number I never heard of, I don't even know where the area code they had is located!
After verifying the information he said he would have it resent the following day. I asked about a refund and was told ""Well I'll have to check, but technically we are still shipping it."" He then walks off. I stand there waiting and he comes back a few minutes later asking if I needed something else. Yeah! How about a time frame? Is he going to call me, should I call him? This was a big refund I was asking for not a couple bucks I could just forget about. He told me to call him later that week. I called three times and went into the store once and he wasn't there any of the times and no one working there would help me. I finally went in yesterday and he was there. I was third in line and by the time I got to the front there were two more people behind me. He said I would need his ""undevoted"" attention and so he needed to help the other people really quickly since he was the only one there. Well he proceeded to help them as well as the other 5 people that walked in after them while I sat and waited. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes he gave me his ""undevoted"" attention which consisted of taking 30 seconds to give me a tracking number  from something I had previously shipped and then another 30 seconds to tell me that he had checked about the refund and was told no because the information was correct and the address is deliverable.

I had purchased an old vintage bike and asked for a full overhaul. No problem, they said have it ready in two days. Went in to pick up the bike and they said they were slammed and did not get to work on it. 

No Problem. 
A week after that and it was not done. 
Another 3 weeks after that and it was not done. 
Another weeks goes by and its not done. 

Having not received one phone call, I finally just go in and ask for the bike. 

I was told that they were waiting on some brake pads and a 28"" x 1 1/2"" tube which, they claimed were both extremely difficult to find. The brake pads perhaps, they were different, but the tube? I bought one the same day just around the corner. That was disappointing.

Now, they did seem to do a good job overhauling the bike and they only charged me for part of the job since I took it before they could finish.

Yet, after 6 weeks of waiting, not receiving one phone call, and some condescending attitudes, I was ready to take my bike back and try another avenue. 

It seems like a cool place, but this was really a bad experience. Two stars for their work, zero for service.

[Edit]

I meant to add this just after I wrote the entry. I had stated above that I understood it may be difficult to find the brake blocks needed for a rod actuated system. This was to give Slippery Pig the benefit of the doubt with regard to why they needed to keep my bike for 6 weeks (and who knows how long it would have taken to get it back had I not walked in there and demanded it back unfinished). 

Well, it took me the better part of half an hour to find a place that would ship the brake blocks to me within 3 days using the advanced technique of the Google search engine. 

Now, there are two excuses Slippery Pig could use in their defense, they just didn't care, or they are incompetent. I think a little of both are involved. Because of this, I am downgrading my review from a 2 to a 1, and will never being taking a bike back there.",review,5,hWlxad7SAlaOEjjnoCiBhQ

When I came into the shop, Eric told me that he wasn't going to do it for that price and it didn't matter what his employees quoted me over the phone. He wasn't willing to help at all and his quote was almost double what I was told over the phone. 

The second time I came into this shop was because I needed my fox rear shop sent in for warranty work. I gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox. I was told there would be a 10 day turn around to get it fixed and back at the shop ready for pickup. Fox called the shop and told them my shock was no longer available. I was originally told that it would cost $100 to get it fixed with the warranty through fox. After fox called the shop and told them they didn't have my shock any more, the price went up to $160. I was ok with that considering what a new one costs retail. For some reason when fox called the store, they didn't call fox back and tell them it was ok to fix it and send it to them at them price. One of the employees of the pig even admitted they dropped the ball and would call fox right away and get this resolved. It took 4 weeks from when I dropped the shock off until it got back to the bike shop. When I went in to pick up the shock and pay for it, it now cost $195. Eric again was not willing to help.

I asked if there was anything he would do for his employees dropping the ball and not returning calls and making this whole process takes weeks longer.

If you sort the reviews for this shop by date, you'll see the 3 most recent reviews below this one are all 1 star, and all for similar reasons: customer service, or lack thereof.  This review is no different.

I am currently in the market for a new mountain bike.  I've done my research, talked to friends who are bike enthusiasts, and I've looked around a few places.  Really, all I needed from Slippery Pig was to get my frame size double checked, and to answer a few questions about some subtle differences between different equipment setups between Cannondale models.  If they had provided those answers, they would have made a sale.

In the past 4 weeks, I stopped by the shop 3 times.  All 3 times, my entry, browsing, and lingering presence went unnoticed.  I was ignored when the shop was somewhat busy (acceptable), but also when there was only one other customer.

I understand that the guys can get busy, or can be distracted, etc.  But how hard is it to get a simple acknowledgment or something like ""Hey, we'll be with you as soon as we can""?  I've gotten more acknowledgment of my presence from strangers in a stadium men's room waiting line than I did from the staff at Slippery Pig.  How hard is it to at least give me a head nod, or even look in my direction?  Actually, I take that back.... I watched them all look at me, but then not say anything.  I even got acknowledged by another customer as I fiddled with price tags, but nothing from the sales guy standing between us both.  Unbelievable.

Well, needless to say, I will not be spending my hard-earned money there.  I wish I could opine like other yelpers about their aloof attitudes, or their knowledgeability, or service.  Sadly, I can't because Slippery Pig never had me at hello.

I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.

Starving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask.",review,4,N-D-d1Z4UybdlkK1HxlNPA

I drove here not expecting much (always known this location as the crappy one), I had been to this location while it was still under the forgotten step-child The Eggery.  I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not, I haven't been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage, I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.

I met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.

When I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up, he didn't succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.

After being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit, and sit, and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, I think we've got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.

He comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.

Food finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?  

I have the Monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  That's no big deal, I don't care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, I have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.

Friend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldn't be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!

We could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say ""Everything ok?"" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no ""thank you"" ""have a good day"" ""come again"" ""bugger off"" nothing....  Mind you I use the word ""busy"" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that I saw.

I had oral surgery yesterday and I went in to the store because there was 6 cars waiting for the drive-thru and this is the only pharmacy even close to my house.  After waiting in line 10 minutes just to drop off my prescription, the guy could notice I was in a great deal of pain and said he'd get my prescription filled within 15 minutes.  I decided to sit in the waiting area and suffer in silence.

First off, I can't believe the authorities allow them to sell medical supplies, treat patients (they have a little doctor's office in back) or fill prescriptions here.  This place is a disgusting mess.  There were 3 chairs available for me to sit in, one had garbage on it, one had what I can only describe as a ""snail trail"" on it and one was tucked in the corner under some advertisements and next to the busy staff door.  After wedging myself into the only ""clean"" chair I started the long painful wait at Walgreens.  Once I left the store, I wanted to take off all my clothes in the parking lot and burn them right there.  I had the worst case of the heebeegeebees and didn't want to take that filth home with me.  ewwwww!!!  

Now, I understand that they're busy and that other people too are in pain or need meds urgently.  I also understand that they have no control over the wackos that they let in the door and that they can't shut up that kid who is screaming and throwing a fit.  But they could at least, at very minimum, be somewhat accurate with how long they tell you it'll be.  I wouldn't have waited if they told me it was going to take 40 minutes.  I don't think I would've waited if they told me 20 minutes.  And from here on out, I won't wait at all, no matter my condition.

12448,HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg,0,2012-06-29,0,HLC5XTuh9Qy4Rtd7ysFcYA,1,"I just left this Walgreens where the pharmacist on duty discriminated against me and publicly humiliated me. 

This is what happened. I'll try to be as detailed as possible, as this review may be used in court one day. First, let me say I have a chronic condition and I am a polite and easy-to-get-along-with ""regular"" of this pharmacy. I've never had an issue before tonight. Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.

However:

I badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.

So he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.

I was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.

So I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.

What I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.

However, the photo ID that I showed was unique. Only certain people get to carry it. I am not saying my ID was a green card (and I'm not saying it wasn't), but a green card would be an example of a government photo ID that is not commonly shown.

But if you are visiting from a foreign country, for example, and you are here legally, you should be able to get prescriptions that you need. I know that Arizonans aren't fond of illegal aliens, but people that are here legally should be able to get medication if they are sick.

Not at this Walgreens. The pharmacist declared, in front of witnesses, that they won't serve everyone. If you are visiting this country, go elsewhere. The pharmacist at this Walgreens will not help you.

Upon inspecting my government issued, legal photo ID (that the bank accepts by the way), the pharmacist said, ""I'll take it this time, but next time, you'll need an ID from the DMV.""

From the DMV! Can you believe it? She actually said ""from the DMV."" 

I said: ""That's a legal government-issued photo ID. You can't deny me.""

She then arrogantly proclaimed: ""I am the pharmacist and that is our policy! We need an ID from the DMV!""

I protested, because, since I don't drive, just going to the DMV is a tremendous pain in the butt. And what law says that you need DMV ID? Who says that you are required to visit the DMV ever? As far as I know, you just need to be able to prove that you are here legally. My ID proved I was here legally. And again, it was government issued photo ID.

Upon me protesting, she snatched my prescriptions from the cashier (all on videotape) and said, ""Then I won't give them to you if you want to argue!""

Okay, so this girl has a power-struggle issue. I get it. 

I'm in agony, and I know when I am dealing with a nut-job, so I satisfied her narcissism and agreed that yes, she was the pharmacist and no, my ID wasn't good enough. And she handed me my prescriptions. Thank God. You see, it was never about the ID. Otherwise, I wouldn't have my Vicodin right now. It was about exerting control over a customer. A regular customer that has spent over a thousand dollars in that store, in 2012.

She actually held pain medication over my head, until I agreed to her illegal, discriminatory policy.

So, in a state of duress, desperate, I relented. I said, ""Okay. I agree."" (clenching my teeth in agony)

As I was walking out, I turned to her and said, ""I am now going to write a review online.""

She replied: ""Good! Go ahead. And now we will never serve you again."" She went over to the computer and publicly announced that she will make a note on my account and that I can't get prescriptions from there anymore. Again, humiliating me in public.

And what did I do? Absolutely nothing. I did nothing wrong. I never even swore or called her a bad name. All on videotape.

Other incidents have included but are probably not limited to: a mysteriously soggy bun, buns that were harder than they should have been, missing food and other various problems typically associated with these type of eateries.

I know it's fast food but come on people. Get it together!

Also keep an eye out for your straw as this Wendy's is notorious for giving you your drink and then giving you nothing to drink your drink with. I don't know why Wendy's insists on putting the straw in the bag since they more often than not forget to.

Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.   I was so sorry to hear of the veterans that had died over these delays in care.  It is a disgrace but I am not surprised at all by this behavior in Phoenix.  They obviously are overwhelmed.

I needed a new car headlight, and they screwed it up and fried my car.  It took three employees hours to get the headlight changed, and in the process of troubleshooting the damage that their sausage fingers had done in the engine, took out some fuse box thing and put it back upside down.  At that point nothing electronic in my car worked, and the car itself wouldn't start the next day.  A competent mechanic fixed it, but it cost me a significant amount of money and time in towing and mechanic fees.  Autozone was not interested in reimbursing me for the damage they had caused.

Old review:
I just got home from having a new battery put in my car, and I was super happy with my new favorite car store!  

I am incompetent at cars, so I went in saying I thought my battery might be mostly dead.  It was.  Car stuff's expensive.  I'll forgive them.  The Autozone kid was super helpful though.  He spent a good half hour inside car, removing the old battery (my car is the ""labor intensive"" kind of battery holder) and gouging out all the corrosion I had let accumulate.  A half an hour!

Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal!

I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!

First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.

For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!

The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. 

The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!

The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!

Another disappointment. The lunch menu is tiny, they didn't even know what Sesame chicken was and my food came out in literally 1 minute which makes me think they have a vat of it sitting in the kitchen pre-made. My  mom ordered the sweet & sour prawns and we were both surprised she could even take a bite to try it... just looked plain nasty.

I came here on a referral from a co-worker. I was lazy about researching through the insurance site and he also lives near our office so I knew he had one I could pop over to on a lunch break. His referral was for Dr. Angela Relf. I Googled the number and made the appt. - they were able to see me the same week. 

When I pull up to the group of offices, I walked into the wrong one. The guy in there said, ""Girls Scouts office is next door."" Ha, that's funny. I explained who I was looking for and he said that was on the other side of the building and that it's not Relf there anymore, but a Dr. Jafari. So I get to the right building and Dr. Relf's name is boldly displayed on the window, but ""Weldon Dental Care"" is on the big sign out front. Whatever, it's a dentist, right?

I'll start with the good stuff, because the bad stuff is really bad.

Good - everyone, from the admin to the tech to the Dr. himself was very nice. And the quickness in getting an appt. that I mentioned before was appreciated.  that's it.

Bad - Wow, ok. First the cleanliness was non-existent. The waiting area seemed fine, but the clientele that came and went as I waited seemed homeless. 

I noticed a sign directing to the bathroom, so I figured I'd hit that up before we got started. I had to walk through the work area to get to the bathroom and was surprised at how run down it was back there - dirty floors and scuffs and holes on/in the walls. The bathroom was not very clean wither but I thought I was just being judgmental.

When I came out, a very nice young man said they were ready to start and led me directly to a room with a very old chair and even older equipment. The tech was sweet, but seemed inexperienced, borderline unprofessional. I know those plastic mouth things are always a drag (for X-rays), but I've never gagged when someone was trying to position it! He apologized and gave me time to recover - again, very nice, but yikes.

He did the X-rays, then said it would take about 30 min for them to ready and left the room. I began to look around at the old and rusty faucets, stains on the counters, filthy (FILTHY) floor and plastic trash can with no bag in it.

 It seemed weird that they had not started the (teeth) cleaning process. I finally flagged down the same tech and asked if I was also scheduled for a cleaning. He looked at my file and said yes, a polishing was to be done. And he moved me to an equally, if not more dirty room. It was so bad - yellowing equipment, grimey floor, grimey equipment - oh, and I found the missing trash bag from the other can - it was PULLED OVER THE BACK AND HEADREST OF MY CHAIR. They were using in lieu of disposable protective sheets made just for that purpose?!! The longer I waited in there, the more nervous I got. I thought back on the clientele and the new doctor and wondered if this was a free clinic that also took regular patients. I considered leaving, but they'd already done X-rays and I'm sure that's the most expensive part of the dentist visit. Would my insurance let me go somewhere else? 

I was texting my co-worker to double check I was in the right place when Dr. Jafari showed up. He was very nice, but seemed unsure about what the next step was. And why was the Dr. doing the cleaning? Isn't that what the tech does? He opened a pack of clean tools and then set them on the table without putting a sheet under them first - what the hell is the point of that? He (without gloves) moved the light and equipment around into the right position (handles on the light had a weird plastic sheet over it, not a disposable full cover you usually see), then put gloves on and touched all the stuff he had touched without them. ugh!

He barely scraped at my teeth (I'm used to them really getting in there and taking care of business, and that's when I used to go regularly - what was this guy doing?) and when the X-rays came back he said I was cavity-free (which is good because I would not have believed anything if they said I need extra work). He seemed knowledgeable to some degree (ex: my gums always bleed when they clean and he went through the possible causes, they were exactly what I'd always heard).

When he was done scraping the tech finished up with the polishing. He changed gloves when he sat down (thank god) and he too seemed to be taking it light on the job. No suction-spray system was used until well into the process. By then I had given up they even possessed such ""high-tech"" tools and had swallowed a mouthful of that gritty paste and saliva. 
OMH - I almost forgot the best part - when he asked if I wanted glasses to protect my eyes/face from the splash-back, he left the room and came back with a pair of SUNGLASSES I had noticed sitting on the counter in the first room. I think they were his. Unbelievable.",review,6,7GC9fVWKa4a1ZmBGLH6Uww

My review probably sounds pretty shocking because the experience WAS shocking. I describe in very accurate detail the specifics of what was dirty and what was handled unprofessionally. I did not exaggerate anything (though I fully admit my use of humor undermines the seriousness of my observations). I'm not complaining that there wasn't bottled water service or TVs, I think that's pretty clear in my review. I'm pointing out that I think (and I'm sure many others would agree) that when you go to an office where people stick their hands and instruments into your mouth, you don't want to look around and see grime on the floors, counters and walls or rust on the sink fixtures. I am not a medical professional, but anyone who has even been to a doctor has seen basic protocol when handling a patient (i.e., watching them open a clean pack of tools, watching them wash their hands in front of you before touching you), and they simply did not follow it here. 
The review is not judgmental; it was fair and honest. I pointed out the good (what little there was of it) and the bad. The doctor and all his techs and receptionist were beyond nice and I said as much. But that's hardly the most important thing here.  
To this day, I regret not walking out after the x-rays were taken. 
I do hope that the office was just in some sort of odd transitional phase and that by the time the other reviewer got there things had changed, I really do. But after what I went through, I'm not willing to give them a second chance. Their lack of professionalism and protocol put me in danger, and that's unacceptable. And not just for me, that's unacceptable for anyone -- the office does pro bono work for the homeless or kids in CPS, that's great, they deserve professional care just as much as I do.",review,3,7GC9fVWKa4a1ZmBGLH6Uww

They were able to book me for a new patient appointment fairly quickly. The front desk guy was very thorough. The staff was friendly.

The bad:

They tried to sell me whitening (multiple times), the dentist told me I needed a crown and potentially a root canal, and many fillings. She insisted I needed a deep clean and would need to book an appointment to get the crown before part of my tooth fell off. I went ahead and got the deep cleaning as it had been a while since my last cleaning. I was skeptical of the other recommendations though, so I drove across the valley to my trustworthy dentist for a second opinion. Turns out that much of the work that the dentist at Weldon recommended was not at all necessary.
On top of that, the office at Weldon looked poorly maintained, with dusty looking countertops and such.
Also, I just got a bill that shows I was charged $55 for ""Oral hygiene instruction"" - which I was NEVER made aware of the fact that I was receiving, or would be charged for, and I was never asked if I wanted it. All it consisted of was the hygienist telling me how to floss (which I already knew), not to use listerine, and then trying to sell me a sonic toothbrush from their office. This is incredibly frustrating that they never told me that the advice was a charged service, as I would have not agreed to it if I was made aware.

If TLDR; * Pushy dentist and hygienist; * Poor facilities; * Unnecessary procedures; * Charged $55 for ""Oral hygiene instruction""  that I never agreed to or knew I was being charged for.",review,1,o2btiIOpZm11wYC-40uMqQ

we stepped inside to a ""please wait to be seated"" sign, so we waited, and waited (as several wait staff passed and looked our way without even a nod of acknowledgement) for about 5 minutes. finally our server approached us and offered inside or patio (we chose patio of course!) she was very nice at first seating and asked for our drink order. since neither of us partake in the appreciation for micro brews, we chose raspberry ciders. we were happy. the crowd was sparse-but present. the weather was fabulous. 

it was a weird set-up with 3 small rooms (patio in between both) and no room to turn around. there was no reason our server should have been perturbed; other than having to maneuver around tables inside, as she hardly had tables. none the less, when she returned with our beers, she plopped them down hard on the table and stormed off. the beers were served lukewarm but we tried to drink them anyways. 

she returned a few minutes later for our order. since it was a toss up between the Corned beef and cabbage & the Fish n chips, i asked the servers opinion, inquiring if the corned beef was sliced thin, of to which she replied ""it isn't sliced thin""-but it was sliced thinner than a nickel, plus the meal wasn't even served with bread or butter; but back to the ordering....

after she took our order, i asked her for 2 cold pint glasses; since the beers were warm (only the bottle was slightly cold). she brought back glasses with ice and straws, pounced them on the rod iron table and went on to tell me why micro brews aren't served in cold pint glasses, saying she didn't have any chilled pint glasses because this is a micro brewery. 

it wasn't until after her lecture on the creation of beer, that i explained that even if there is a right way to serve-some people do request chilled pints. i explained that i wasn't a beer afficionado, i just wanted to drink my beer the way it should be served ""chilled"" she gave me attitude, walked away and then returned with two cold pint glasses, pouncing them on the table as she uttered ""here these are for our Root Beer"" while she turned on her heels to run. 

the rest of the meal was pleasant, as she was hardly available. the only time i seen any of the female servers was when an assumingly wealthy man was spotted, that was when most of the servers would approach and hug them (much to close by restaurant standards) very tightly. however most tables around us were either taken by lesbians or hetero females so the ladies weren't hoovering around us too much.  

we received the credit card bill to sign, which was also plopped off mid walkaway. the tables are patio tables with holes, so most people with common sense would prepare for the signing of the bill with a hard bottom of some sort, but not here! they are all consumed with the spotting of rich men and instructions for micro brewing that they don't have time to serve or be of assistance, so be prepared to either pay them upfront to be treated like a patron, or flash your directors card because they seem to think this is suddenly Scottsdale. 

on to the food. i tasted my sisters fish and chips and the homemade chips were soggy from the fish. the halibut was delicious although sister had to pull off all the breading, because it was as thick as an Indian popover. they did serve it with spicy ketchup which was surprisingly delicious. my corned beef cabbage was served paper thin, without bread or butter; but it was still very tasty. the red potatoes soft and the carrots & cabbage blanched to perfection. next time i'll just try sitting at the bar.",review,4,0g6TyhGJXvLQNr7d7LsDnw

The majority of the beer was just plain boring, and warm to boot! They had a lager, wheat, amber, pale, oatmeal stout and a scottish red on draft.  None of the beer sampled tasted even close to what I would consider the fundamentals of that particular category, ie a very bitter amber ale and a sweet, and not-hoppy-whatsoever pale ale.  Even the root beer was flat and tasteless.  

I initially was going to give this place two stars, mainly because they do serve beer, and the bartender was nice,  but thinking about the beer, I have to knock this down to one star.

I really, really want to like it. I'm always on the lookout for a local joint that is special, a place I can take out-of-towners and say, ""This is one more thing I love about Phoenix."" I had high expectations for SunUp since it is in my neighborhood, a short ride or healthy walk away from home

But after several visits over the last couple of months and as many disappointments, SunUp Brewing is on my list of places I might go if I'm desperate, not as a destination, and certainly not a place I want representing my city to friends from elsewhere.

I'm no beer aficionado, but I know what I like, and for the most part I like the brews at SunUp. I particularly enjoy the Light Rail Pale Ale as a mild-bodied thirst-quencher, and the Vanilla Porter, which is rich without being too sweet or heavy. I also like seeing what seasonal offerings they have, many of which I enjoyed.

One constant on my many visits, however, is the truly bad customer service. I don't care if you make minimum wage or six figures; if your job is to take orders and serve people, then do it. Many other Yelp reviewers indicate they have suffered lackadaisical customer service at SunUp, and my experience is that this is the rule, not the exception.

Take today, for example: At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, the place was virtually empty save for about three tables and a couple in the main bar area. The last problem I thought I'd have would be getting attention, but my disinterested server/bartender pulled a disappearing act after pouring my beer and plopping my burger in front of me. She was more interested in sitting in a booth in the adjacent room with a paper in front of her, watching TV.

If she had bothered to follow up with her customer, she would've learned my burger was the opposite of the medium-rare burger I ordered. Even more aggravating was when she did walk quickly past me (including one time when she told the other server she as heading out back, presumably for a break), she looked directly at my barely touched meal but didn't inquire as to why I wasn't eating it. I'm not going to chase down a server, especially if it involves going room to room to find her. All she had to do was notice I hadn't touched my meal for 20 minutes and ask if everything was OK.

I've had similar experiences with the staff at SunUp before although this example was the most egregious. Like other reviewers, I've waited at the bar either with a growler ready to be filled or a bill I'm trying to pay while the bartender chatted with friends even after acknowledging me.

It shouldn't be this hard to find a place that wants to sell me something, but evidently the folks at SunUp have more cash than they need, so I see no reason to spend mine there again.",review,1,UTfCEpXfAJCA7T2T4EEQsw

Went to Four Peaks and Papago and were very pleased with the service, food, and beer.  We hit up Sun Up the following day hoping for an equally pleasurable experience.  That couldn't have been further from reality...

We got a sampler of their 6 regular brews as well as a sample of their 2 seasonals.  We had to choke down almost every one of them (the exception was their seasonal amber, which wasn't too bad but not worth ordering more than 4 oz of).  The waitstaff was not very friendly at all and seemed miffed that we didn't want food or more beer.  After chugging what beer I could and having a glass of water, I hit the restroom before leaving.  Wow.  Big mistake.  It smelled like an outhouse in there-- the ""poo fermenting in the middle of summer but you've had to pee so bad after a 4 hour hike so you'll go anyway but hold your breath"" kind of outhouse. Ick :P

Perhaps I am biased because we are from Fort Collins and are spoiled with the likes of New Belgium, O'Dells, and Equinox all within a couple miles of our house.  However, the service and stinky bathrooms were bad enough that had their beer been phenomenal, I still would have just given this place 3 stars...maybe.

13556,leFRt1SBYL4ZHalLLTlbsQ,0,2012-08-11,1,N99cbBQEiPOtLJhNAftLQA,1,"I'll start  with the good--the actual unit themselves are very nice, especially compared to most of the complexes near the downtown area, and the prices were fair (I signed a lease in the summer of 2011 so I'm not sure what current rates are). We have the large 2 bedroom and it doesn't feel cramped like most apartments. The location is close to a light rail stop (Central & Indian School) and across the street from Steele Indian Park which holds a lot of great local events & even has a dog park. Great pools and the gym is ok. 

Now with the bad. The management here is completely unhelpful. They actually changed management a few months ago but from what I have experienced they are no more helpful than the last. 

The previous management never did an actual walk-through with us, just had us fill out the form and drop it off. They never gave us the key to our patio storage and we still do not have it (we tried 2-3 times to inquire and just gave up after that). They would take weeks to complete maintenance orders (simple or complicated), obviously a sign of bad management. It even took them months to get us copies of the gate keys.

Right as they switched over management there was for some reason a large pool of white paint in one of the parking garage spots. My toddler almost slipped in it, getting paint all over herself and I. I spoke to someone now under the new management and they said they would look into it. Who knows if they did. 

It seems they've tried to employ ""fun"" things with iliveheretoo.com and a meet & greet with management staff. I feel as though they should have improved their basic customer service and maintenance before even thinking about those things. They sent out a letter for Fourth of July stating that they would be providing security for our parking garage and to ensure no reserved spots would be taken by event attendees. The park holds a large fireworks event, so there is a lot of traffic. Well as we pull in we see the hired security and think ""Awesome!"" but we pull in to our space and there is someone in it! So I don't know what kind of process the management relayed to this hired security but it was obviously not thought through. The security let us know that they could tow, but we would need the tow card--which they ALSO NEVER GAVE US. They also promised the top floor of the garage would be reserved and blocked off for residents to bring chairs and watch the show. They didn't come through on that either. There were tons of cars parked and even more that were still trying to drive through the loads of pedestrians (including children) making it very dangerous. 

They scheduled the apartment above me to be turned over on an early Saturday morning with the banging and noise continuing well on into the afternoon. After calling in and asking why they would do this on a weekend the explanation was ""well if they don't do it today the people can't move in."" Which to my reaction is great, what about the people who pay and already live here?! You mean to tell me they couldn't schedule themselves correctly and move it 2 days to a Monday? Another mis-management of their maintenance scheduling. 

Other issues include overflowing garbage that's right inside the garage,  pigeon/cat/dog waste, big security gate breaks often (defeating the 'security') part. When it rains you can just smell all the dog and cat pee. I love animals--but they should really work on controlling this issue. They could probably benefit from working with a shelter or a trap-neuter-return organization for all the stray cats. They could also pay more attention to which residents are not cleaning up after their pets. There are several areas in the complex and in the garage as well that are caked with pigeon feces. 

I know this is long and I probably sounds like a grump, but just don't want anyone to be sold alone on the units aesthetics like I was. I think ""The Station"" just down the street might be owned by the same company? I've been there and its SO much cleaner and nice--but I think that's because they cater to a higher price point, sadly.

Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. 

But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.

While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. 

So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.

""Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,"" we say, playfully.

The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with ""Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out"" before walking off with his cigarette.

""What the hell just happened?"" I ask.
""He thinks we're a straight couple."" 
I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.

I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. 

I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.

I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.

I absolutely will not be coming back another time because that behavior was nuts! I worked many boutique retail jobs throughout college and would never have treated a customer that way.

Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!

But the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!

This self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly ""Chicago thin crust"".

Wall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.

This particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option. 

Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.

The negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain.

She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered!

A few months ago, I yelped about the poor service I got at Oregano's on Camelback, all because I wanted extra sauce both on my deep dish pizza and on the side.  The counte-rgal charged me $15 for a cup of sauce.  Not acceptable.  

After I yelped, I was immediately contacted by Oregano's customer service and they assured me this was not part of their policy.  She sent me gift certificates.  Further, she intimated that a management change had occurred.  Well, last night, I was AGAIN being over-charged for sauce -- BY THE VERY SAME MANAGER!!.

According to Ron, the manager, a 3 oz cup of marinara is $.99.  The cup I pointed to was a ten ounce cup.  So, to fill that would be ""about"" $3, right?  WRONG.  But how Ron gets to $10 or $15 for a cup of sauce is beyond me...and it's certainly beyond Ron's mathematical skills.

When he offered to charge me a certain amount for the sauce, I said, ""No, make it something, a formula, something to rely on in the future"".  

""YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE"", he said, making me feel 'extra special' in a not-so-nice sort of way.  Even if that is true, why berate the customer?  Isn't Ron's job to make feel special...in a positive way?  Not everyone likes the same thing....

So, he knew I was the one who had complained earlier.  He must know that Oregano's customer service thought enough of my complaint to contact me to ""make it right"", but that didn't matter.  Again, he made me feel as though I interrupted his day.  Of course, as a customer, I think I'm the very PURPOSE of his day...me and my $25 for a pizza pie.

AND HOSPITALITY?  It's called the ""hospitality"" business, right?  How was Ron, in any way, ""hospitable""?  Answer: he was not.  What a crappy ambassador he is for Oregano's.

That speaks VOLUMES about what kind of customer service is to be expected. This is the WORST dry cleaner I have ever gone to, bar none. Three times now I have paid top dollar to have Betsey Johnson dresses cleaned, only to have them returned looking exactly the same as when I dropped them off. Before last week, the last dress I had brought in (which cost me $12.00 on eBay, and that included shipping) cost me $22.00, $11.00 for the dress itself, & $11.00 for the polyester under-slip. There was a spot on the dress when I brought it in which was still there when I picked it up, however, since there was no notification that the spot couldn't be removed, I thought I was going home with a clean dress--as was the case with both other dresses. Btw, DANA argued with me and implied that I am a liar because I said that none of the three items had a tag on them indicating there was a spot that couldn't be removed. Because I had already had two experiences in the past with spots that weren't spot-cleaned, I decided to try hand washing the third dress before donating it to Goodwill...lo & behold, the spot came out. Customers get sick of going back, wasting PRECIOUS time & more money to get things done right, which was why I decided not to bring that particular dress back in. Last week I decided to give them one more chance, so I brought in three dresses to be pressed & one sleeveless gauze top. One of the dresses has layers, but I was not advised when I dropped it off that pressing it would cost $17.00. The other two dresses evidently cost $11.00 apiece to press, & the gauze top about $7.00. At that time, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED for the price to press long dresses, & the clerk, Mayra, told me it would cost about a dollar less than the dry cleaning process. She did not mention A THING about the layered dress costing $6.00 more...evidently I was supposed to intuitively know that the question needed to be asked. In other words, A LIE BY OMISSION. So I spent around $46.00 for the pressing of three dresses & the dry cleaning of one cotton top. I had asked for an $11.00 discount on the current order based on the fact that they didn't do the job right on the last dress I had brought in, & the owner, DANA (DANA wanted me to be sure to mention DANA's name here...happy to oblige!) started shaking and hyperventilating because I told DANA I thought a discount was in order for the inconvenience, as well as the spot that was still present on the last dress after I got it home...which cost me $11.00. I don't think even wealthy people--which I am not--feel they have money like that to blow. I asked DANA what was WRONG with DANA, treating a customer this way, & DANA's response was that DANA is the owner & that DANA can treat me however DANA likes. Man, do I pity DANA's employees. I wasn't asking for an additional $11.00 refund for the extra charge to clean a SLIP. Anyway, evidently DANA would rather make herself sick than be kind/accommodating to a customer. In the two years I was their customer, I had asked twice to have spots re-cleaned, NOT FOR REFUNDS OR CREDITS, yet today DANA basically told me I am a malcontent because I don't like to spend tons of money for nothing. And then DANA said I complained EVERY TIME I picked something up...so DANA is a LIAR, too. Believe me, if I had had that many complaints prior to today, I would have stopped bringing my clothes there a long time ago...today's experience was the FOURTH strike, which is more chances than I give most people who take my money, do a substandard job & then try to blame me instead of doing the right thing by admitting they made a mistake. SPARE ME. And yes, I consider the way DANA treated me--& the job FASHION CLEANERS did--a form of r@pe, because unless I paid their price, I was powerless to get back what is mine (which didn't bother me so much until I paid them $22.00 FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING). DANA's complete lack of customer service--& outright RUDENESS to a customer who, in the past, had referred OTHER people to spend their money at Fashion Cleaners--ensured that I won't go back. DANA actually accused ME of being defensive!!!! The girl who waited on me, Mayra, admitted when I left that I had always been very kind in the past, until DANA had a total meltdown today--obviously DANA doesn't know HOW to take criticism. My advice to DANA:  If DANA can't stand the heat, DANA should get shrunk and out of the freakin' kitchen. DANA does not belong in a customer-service oriented profession. PATHETIC. Three strikes, and I gave them the GIFT of another. YOU'RE OUT!

I am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!

Fast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine.

Caprese sandwich and breaded mushrooms with (curdled) ranch.

Sandwich seemed to come with strange rectangular processed mozzerela, and, aside from the strong purple onions, it was practically flavorless.

Were they real mushrooms? I don't know, I threw them out after one bite. The ranch dressing was curdled anyway (!!!), so they were beyond salvage.

The problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.

So in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left.

This place has decent ambience. That's about it. The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly, non-welcomy, and probably non-existent!

The biggest offense is the food! I cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive. I came in a little late (9:15 p.m.) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong, but there were 2 other parties that came in after me.

Going back to the food. I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu. 
1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really? Salmon??? It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso?? There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  

2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get? A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce? Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!

3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.  The guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water!

I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table.  I know it is sealed but, really??? in front of customers?

This place really cut corners in terms of food and service. 

Benefit of doubt? Maybe, since I tried this place only once, but once is enough for me. I saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself. Not impressed at all.

The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! 

If you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). 

The sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? 

The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!

What about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. 

Are we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.

So why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food.

Hello:

Yesterday afternoon I found myself in the unfortunate position of being 350 miles from my studio without a piece of equipment.  While I was driving into Phoenix from Los Angeles,I realized we had left a posing stool. We called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one. We were told yes. We then set a course to come to your store immediately.  Unfortunately, coming from CA we didn't realize you we're 1 hour aead of us.  We called once the realization hit. We had 75 minutes to travel 60 miles.  We made every effort to arrive by 6:00, as we were told rather rudely, that the store was closing at 6 sharp.  At 5:55, from about 4 blocks away, we called again and asked if they could ready our purchase, that we would run in and buy. We were told NO, that we better arrive before 6, that ""You have 4 minutes"".  I cannot begin to express the frustration and anger that your store couldn't accommodate a simple request, and was completely unsympathetic to the fact that we were driving straight from LA to you.  In fact, I arrived at 6:00 on the dot, as Randy I believe was locking the door.  He could have cared less. While part of me says, ""the people who run this store don't care about anything, why write this email"", as a business owner and potential customer, you deserve to know why I will make it my personal mission on every review site, website etc to let other potential customers know, just how much you value our business.

I have never been treated like that by any company or vendor, and as a fellow business owner, I'm appalled by the blatant attitude and disrespect. I don't know any other company who wouldn't have gladly tried to help us or offered a solution acceptable to both.

Get with the program.  The price of the lens is $399 retail.  Don't tell me you only make $20 on a lens sale.

If you want to survive as a local business, you need to be nice to your customers.  If you don't want to price match then be nice about it.  Don't try to bully someone into  buying something.  If you know a customer is just going to order it, I think you would be better off selling it and only making $20, then losing that business and any future business from the customer.  I have personally spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on photography equipment, always the highest end lenses, and camera bodies.  In fact I bought my last camera body at their store, but I will never make that mistake again.

A woman named CHARMION BILLINGTON answered the phone.  

Never in my life have I experienced a more curt, rude, inconsiderate ""ambassador"" of a country club.

This woman embodies everything that is stereotypical, negative, and distasteful in private country clubs.

I called to inquire about the start times of the tennis matches of the tournament.  Charmion proceeded to inform me, rather dismissively, that she didn't know the times of the matches and nobody was around who did.  

I told her I came in from out of town to see the matches.  Did she know of a website that might have the informaiton I wanted?  She said she didn't know of any website and flatly told me to call back ""tomorrow morning'.

SHE THEN HUNG UP ON ME.

No kidding.  While I was mid-sentence (to thank her, ironically), she hung up.

I went to the tennis matches, in spite of Charmion's classless and rude behavior.  

Everyone else at the club was friendly, helpful, and welcoming.

Perhaps I caught Charmion on a bad day.  But this in no way excuses her complete lack of professionalism.  

Phoenix Country Club ought to re-evaluate this woman.  She is a discredit to their business.",review,6,XVFEmpeTFe0RYHW3jOemAA

Cassidy Cavin,
ARE YOU JOKING! EARN OUR BUSINESS? EVERYONE READ THE BELOW PRIOR TO GOING TO COULTER CADILLAC! 
As promised we came back to your dealership last night. Your New Car Manager, PAUL GLANS"" was very rude with us using the old scum bag CAR SALES tactics claiming he lost the key to the White Diamond 2013 Escalade Platinum which I spent over 2 hours previewing earlier in the afternoon. You were aware we were coming back last night? YOU AND THIS SCUM BAG waisted our time? I told you that my wife was a CFO and conducting Board meetings all week and we had a short window to buy the 2013 Escalade Platinum. We even called you to ask you to pull the auto out while headed there so my wife could see the auto which you agreed to do? PAUL GLANS (THE SCUM BAG) was insisting to walk around our ""trade in"" 2011 BMW 550i in advance to even showing my wife the 2013 Escalade Platinum?  Uhhh... this is 2013 not 1980? Flash-back??? I gave you guys the info on the trade earlier in the day including a pay off amount. This is horrible business. You and PAUL GLANS were cherry picking us which is a form of discrimination! EVERYONE READ THIS! This happens to be Coulter Cadillac, you and PAUL GLANS problem, not ours, as we immediately called Mike at LUND Cadillac who has inegtity and merrit and is dropped off a Platinum Escalade ESV Black Ice to our house the next morning. YOU LOST A SALE! Cassidy, we suggest you go to a more repitable dealer to work in sales capacity as long as that scum bag PAUL GLANS is working there. We also suggest PAUL GLANS crawl back into the hole he crawled out of as we are headed to all the online reporting sites to share this horrible experience with the Universe. PAUL, you can't discriminate, cherry pick and treat customers like this.  Question? Does the owner of Coulter Cadillac even know that PAUL GLANS treated us like this or is that scum bags trying to sweep it under the rug as if nothing happened? One thing is for sure, the owners WILL read about it. Go to your BBB page. Thank you, Valued Customer 

Dear Amy and David,

I sincerely apologize for what happened last night. I always want to give my customers first class service, and unfortunately you did not receive it. So if there is anything I can do to still earn your business and make things right or possibly your business in the future, please let me know! 

Thank you,

I went to have my car serviced from a light that came on.  The next day they called me to tell me the problem and added that my oil pan and radiator where leaking badly and that I needed to replace my Radiator and pull the oil pan to replace the gasket at a cost of near $2,000 total.  What I found odd was that my 7 year old car had not dropped anything in my driveway or garage.

I decided to not have the work done by them and took it to another garage to have looked at.  They told me both where fine and that I had been lied to.

Since I have kept a drip pan under my car and after months, still not a single drop of oil or radiator fluid.  While it is there, I had them change a belt which clearly was not done as this is NOT a new belt.

When I showed up, I was told it would take about 2 hours because they were getting backed up, this despite the fact I had called ahead. When I repeated this fact, the manager-who seemed like he could not care less about my business on either occasion-said we could ""move things around"" to speed it up.

We, my daughter (who's coats these were) and I, returned to Tony's a week later to pick up both coats. My daughter tried on the first coat, that only needed the sleeves shortened, and she looked a bit apprehensive and a bit perplexed. But none-the-less she opted to take the coat as she was leaving back to college and needed the coat. When we left Tony's my daughter commented that it didn't feel right in the sleeves, as if it was bunching and it felt uncomfortable to her. I told her to leave it but she insisted that she would need a coat.

The second coat that needed both the sleeves and length shortened was left there because they said it wasn't ready and would be another week. When I returned a week later to pick up the coat it was very visible to me that the job was not done properly. The front of the coat was uneven, I would come to later find out, it was a whole 1/2 inch off. Also, at the bottom of both the right and left sides of the coat there was a zigzag stitch that shouldn't have been there, it should have been a straight stitch. The sleeves also looked as if there was too much lining fabric where it joins the exterior of the coat. From the backside of the coat, at the bottom, the lining was visible (hanging down too far). When I questioned the employee she said her seamstress was gone for the day and to just leave the coat there so she could fix it.

When I returned 2 weeks later to pick up the coat there were no changes made to the coat at all. When I questioned the owner about why the seamstress put a zigzag stitch on the two bottom sides she said that was the only way it could be done to close the coat. I asked why the seamstress didn't go in from inside the lining and she said, ""That would have been too much work"". When questioned why it was still uneven she said it was because it was on the hanger and that once I put the coat on it would be fine. I explained to her that that wasn't the way it was when I originally purchased the coat, that the coat was nice and even at the bottom. She insisted I put the coat on, I told her it wasn't my coat and it wouldn't fit me because the coat belonged to my daughter who was away at college by this time.

By this time I just wanted to take my coat somewhere else to have it fixed but she was insistent on having the seamstress do repairs right then while I waited. I told her no that the coat had already been left there for them to fix and they failed to do anything to fix it in the three weeks since it was originally promised to me. I simply wanted my coat and I expressed that I wasn't going to pay for it because the job wasn't done properly and she grabbed my coat. I then pulled out my cell phone to call the police so that I could get my merchandise back and she proceeded to charge me for the work done, even though it was very clear that I was not satisfied and I was neither confident nor comfortable with leaving my coat any longer. The owner proceeded to tell me to never bring anything to her again and I promised her I wouldn't.

It's been several weeks but I've since had this coat fixed by FIT ALTERATIONS, they did a phenomenal job! I would advise to NEVER take anything to TONY'S CLEANERS AND TAILORS FOR ALTERATIONS. I really don't think the seamstress knows what she's doing.",review,1,Wf5og9W2QDdAC0lflUzn7g

In the past year, business seems to have gone up to the point that they CANNOT MAINTAIN PREVIOUS LEVELS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ""MOM AND POP"" CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Maybe the perfect 5 star rating here has something to do with that, causing business to explode.  However, when this happens a business either expands, or customer service declines.  Precision imports does not seem to desire expansion, and their customer service has become inconsistent and disorganized.  

Trust is vital with your mechanic, and Frank/Al broke trust with me in a few areas.  I trusted them up until the past year.  Earlier this year Al diagnosed my Nissan with a ""pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.""  I have not seen any oil leaking from the Nissan, but they assured me ""just wait it's going to leak.""  

Later this year, the service engine light came on in my BMW.  I trusted that Precision Imports would run appropriate diagnostics.  They did not.  Instead, they insisted that I had ""run my car too low on gas, which caused the light to come on"" and rebuked me not do let the gas run too low in the future.  (I had not recently let my tank get too low, and it had been low in the past but never caused problems with the service engine light). They got the service engine light off, and charged me $45.  

A few days later, the service engine light came back on.  I thought, ok, the problem must be more serious or a new problem.  I brought my car in.  After several days of waiting, I called to a rude response that they were ""extremely busy and just hold on we'll call you when it's ready!""  I let it go, and let a few more days go by.  I called back again, and was returned ""It's been ready come and get your car!""  When I pointed out the poor customer service politely, I was returned with ""Sorry we've been swamped.""

When I came to pick my car up, the reason given as to why the light was on astonished me: ""pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.""  SAME SUPPOSED ""COMMON"" PROBLEM AS MY NISSAN WORD FOR WORD!  AND, they were unable to switch off my service engine light.  I just stared at him.  My read: FULL OF BS.  I said nothing regarding this diagnosis, paid, and left.

I have googled this problem in both cars, and asked around a little.  Neither is a common problem in either car from what I""ve found.  I was even told they have patch kits for the problem, which was never offered to me as an option.

I should add that I also have had 2 ""underquotes"" on mechanical problems here.  I mean, quoted by phone at one cost, then when I go to pay it was higher.  When I've asked about the higher cost, i feel I was given lines of BS.

WHY DOES A SECOND OPINION MATTER?

The next day I was driving my BMW.  Now call me a jackass for not opening my engine and checking the coolant, but the car was JUST serviced (including oil change, etc) at Precision Imports!  My car started smoking like crazy, and died on busy Bell road.  I was able to get the car into another auto shop.  They found out THE COOLANT WAS EMPTY.  THIS IS WHY THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  The charge was $10.  PROBLEM SOLVED, smooth sailing since.  

I have now taken both cars to 2 different mechanics.  Nothing has been discovered in the area of ""pinhole oil leak"" on either car.

It used to be that Frank always overstated the price a little, went above and beyond with communication, and took care of me.  He came across as an honest old school guy to me.  It's different now.  Frank's more detached.  I get the feeling Frank is eying retirement, and would prefer working on a much much lower volume of cars.  No comment on the younger guy Al.  Earlier this year when I brought my car in Frank said ""make sure you deal with me.""  I didn't make much of it, but this could have indicated some other issue going on at the shop.  I did attempt to deal only with Frank this year, but his availability has been very low and he had to route me to Al and others.

I saw a few guys in the shop with a lot of signs pointing to ""previously convicted felon.""  I'm all about turning it around and 2nd chances, and I realize this can be a staple of many mechanic shops.   But, business is business and I didn't get a good feeling about a few of the newer mechanics in the shop.

I gave them several second chances, and communicated my concerns honestly and appropriately.  But that's it for me.  They lost me as a customer.  I'm hoping that they can turn it around, but for starters they are going to need to lose more customers and reduce the extreme volume or expand to a new location.

So I turn to the Volvo specialists I've used lots of times before for my own Volvo with few issues...except perhaps for the uncomfortable, stony silence they give you when your budget is bottomed out and you politely decline one of their suggested, additional services while embarrassedly explaining that you'll have to wait to get it done until you have more money.  Very uncomfortable.

So I'm thinking, no problem, these guys know their stuff, right? Apparently it *was* a problem, because after I made an appointment and dropped off my daughter's car, it took them 3 weeks and over $600 and the car STILL doesn't run!  :/ 

Adding to this, my husband and I had to call every few days and ask for an update on the car because we weren't being updated on the progress of the repair at all.  Have you ever had to placate an impatient 17 year old girl who needs her car to get to and from school?  It's living hell.

In fact, during one of the calls I made about the car's status, I discovered that they had replaced both oxygen sensors but that wasn't the problem, but they thought they had sorted out what the new hold up was but that nobody had gotten around to calling us to let us know any of this yet, and when I authorized them over the phone to address the new issue the response to me was ""Well, we have all these other cars ahead of you now"".  Wait...what?  Am I not ALSO a paying customer that also had an appointment?  How did I suddenly lose my place in 'line' behind all these other customers?  Shouldn't you finish my car before starting work on a different car?  :/

So yeah, after 3 weeks and over $600 they finally declared that they just didn't know what else to do with it and we paid our bill and picked up the car.  Fast forward a few months and it still hasn't passed emissions and just sits in my driveway, covered in dust, because I gave Volvo Am I all the money we could scrape together to sink into it and now I'm nervous to spend another penny since they couldn't figure it out the first time.   

I'm not sure if I'm more offended that they thought we could afford repairs approaching half of the value of the car, or that we didn't deserve any follow up communications on the repair status, or that when I called to find out what was going on I discovered that we'd been dropped to the back of the line for no discernible reason whatsoever.

There weren't any standouts among the dishes- most everything was pretty generic. My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom... somehow, we were able to time our vomiting. In retrospect, it's kinda impressive.

I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature. As others mentioned, the chef spent a lot of time checking on the dishes, but he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid.

Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought ""why not Chinese?""  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.

Being greeted on the way in with a ""You are on camera"" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.

But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.

The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the ""orange chicken"" from the ""sesame chicken"" from the ""pepper chicken"" by any sense other than sight.

The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).

The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.

They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.

Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was ""up"" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.

The soup was also cold.

Chopped liver tasted like liver... ""Livery"". At better delis, the chopped liver is smooth and creamy-- slightly sweet. This was bitter and not smooth. Unpleasant.

On top of that, they served it with bagel chips... Which is great, except a few good sized bagel chips were cinnamon-raisen. You gotta be kidding me. With liver? Disgusting.

Meatloaf was a friggin' nightmare. Not sliced from a loaf, but a patty that was baked. Super well done, chewy crap. Served with a beef base gravy, and they used way too much beef base.

Carrots were overcooked; mashed potatoes were ordinary.

During the end of the lunch rush Scott's was empty. That should have been a sign. The restaurant was filthy. The temperature was hot and sticky despite having the the door open (it was about 72 in phoenix today.)

The booths had exposed cushioning, tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned and the floor looked like something that belonged in an episode of kitchen nightmares. Ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part. 

My friend and I finally found a clean-ish booth and sat down. Our table was dirty, and when the waitress came by I had to ask her to wipe it off even though there were visible crumbs and our menus were sticky. She acted like it had never occurred to her to clean a table off before. She actually tilted her head when I asked her to do so, as if she had been confused by the request. We should have just left. 

We ordered our food. I got a pathetic bowl of matzo ball soup, my friend a sad looking chicken noodle. I had one very tiny measly looking matzo ball, and the veggies had been cooked to death. There were chicken bones in my soup. The flavor tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic version of Stouffer's dressing mix. 

I ordered a lean pastrami and asked for it to go. It came to our table without fries  accompanied by the saddest, wilted coleslaw. It was not prepared to go. The pastrami was fatty (despite the menu bragging about how they don't charge extra for lean) The pickles were great, and house made. The pickles were the only bright spot of the meal. 

My friend asked if they had soda by the bottle, the waitress forgot that they carried Dr Brown's (a deli staple) and I had to jog her memory. She forgot the request twice and after being reminded twice she finally brought the soda.

By this point I was so over it I just wanted to leave. I asked for a box, she over charged us, I didn't give a flying fig about that and over paid just to be able to leave.

UNTIL they wanted my FINGERPRINTS and PALMPRINT  in order to rent a space I was ok with everything. I asked why.When I said that I was all for biometrics for safety they looked at me confused as they did not understand what that was.When I informed them that it involves the use of a fingerprint in order to gain access they stated that they weren't that advanced yet.
I then asked what they wanted my fingerprints and palmprint for and they stated security.I then asked that if my fingerprints were going to be compared every time someones' storage facility was broken into and they stated NO.I then asked what do you want fingerprints for then.
You can go to a bank and cash a sizeable check and they require an index finger print,which I can understand,BUT this is a storage facility for crying out loud and people are required to have or purchase insurance in case of something happening.All it takes is a disgruntled employee lifting your prints to place elsewhere and frame someone for a crime.
I even tried calling the district mgr.(from outside the facility) for a further clarification and left a voicemail message to call me as he did not answer. I was also asked to leave the facility in the middle of my phone call.I complied. I am still waiting 2 days later for a return call.
Potential renters BEWARE AND TAKE NOTICE!!!
This is NOT a place to rent storage space from.
They are obviously treating everyone that rents from them as a criminal element.THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR DEMANDS TO SUPPLY FINGERPRINTS.
I asked them should a storage unit get broken into are they then going to run my fingerprints in a database in order to eliminate me from being a suspect in the break in and they stated NO.I then again asked them what they needed fingerprints supplied to them for and they stated MY safety.Sounds VERY FISHY ro me.
Needless to say I am NOT RENTING from this concern
When I asked other facilities around town if that is a requirement in order to rent from them they all laugh and say no.For the people that do supply them with fingerprints and rent from them, they must be idiots.
You can lift fingerprints from a fingerprint card with scotch tape and plant it anywhere you like.It is that easy.

Hubs and I stopped for breakfast.  We looked at the line @ Matt's (I know there IS no comparison but the line was SOOOOOOOOOOOO long) and turned around to get one of the worst tasting meals and worst service experiences I've had in a long time.  

Now, I understand something going wrong with your order now and again.  But seriously, our waitress was training someone!!!!!  An order was taken and then we were left to fend for ourselves.

We saw the cooks working and putting food out that just sat under the lamps.  When we got our grand slams the only thing slightly warm were the eggs.  Sausage?  Stone cold.  Bacon: frigid.  Pancakes, laughable.

And when the manager stopped by?  Let's just say that he had a very condescending attitude.  He was basically like; ""well, what do you want me to do about it?""  Um, manage your people effectively!  Live up to the customer service standards expected of you!  Figure it out.  My husband pretty much put him in his place by giving a detailed description of several things he'd seen done wrong since our arrival.

With that, I'm already out of things I like, so I suggest you spend no more than that here and leave.   

I only went to meet friends, and a good friend at that.  I would have passed any other time.   

I order a Stella on draught, served right, even in the Stella glass.  They do know how to serve beer and other alcoholic drinks here, like, in the strictest sense of being able to pour a non-skunked brew or a strong cocktail in the right glass.   Not much else, unfortunately.

$4.75, the bartender tells me.  I hand him my Visa.  

""It's cash only.""   

My vision blurs as I strain to quell my irritation as we're already off to a great start.  I should have left right there, but that would have probably been illegal and the Stella looked pretty good.  

I take out a $20 from the ATM, the last ATM in Arizona that still dials out. So I spent my time waiting looking for skimmers because nobody else would have noticed one in a place this cheap.   

I like paying $5 in fees for a $5.75 beer.   I really do.   (With tip, as its not his fault his job sucks.)

As I find out, I pulled the last $20 out of the ATM before it *ran out of money.*  If I intended on pulling more out to lessen the 25% tax on my cash, I would've been doubly irritated.  

So when the bartender switches the policy from ""cash only"" to ""we take plastic"" after I just went out of my way and money to comply...I didn't know there was another reason I don't want to go back but the morons who run this place figured one out.  

The stale-beer-and-sweat smell was getting to me by the time my friend needed a cigarette.   But forget seeking your respite on their ""patio.""    

Their ""patio"" is more like a planemullkip, a word I had to just make up from the German translation for ""a tarp stretched over a garbage dump.""  

No prior English word better describes this pathetic joke--It smells worse outside, there's no furniture, but there is plenty of garbage and you can't even take your drink out.

Maybe it's intentional--they've duplicated being just as cheap, annoying, and lazy on the outside as they have inside.   The tiny bathroom that forces everyone to watch you take a dump is just like the rest of the place:  all the charm and appeal of a rural county lock-up, right down to the same suicide-proof sheet-metal toilet.  Even if you get off on this sort of thing despite the many inherent travesties, go elsewhere.  

Incidentally, I really like setting my coaster on top of my drink and adjusting it so just in case one of the creepy trolls here GHB's my drink, I'll notice.

A use permit is something like $500 from the city for outdoor alcohol  consumption, and they might pay that much in fencing.   Instead, I just I don't get it.  I first went here 7 years ago and I can tell they've made about $300 in capital improvements since then, all from Goodwill.

Outside lives a $30 heater, they have a $150 website, and $100 for a used LCD or two.   One of the LCDs was displaying a completely different faded illegible picture than the one on the same channel next to it, putting the rampant cheapness here in striking contrast to the one new thing that worked--the jukebox probably wasn't theirs and didn't work either.   Who even knew you could get a website from Goodwill?

The last $20 they must have spent is for the annoying plastic flaps they hang on the back door to lessen their AC bills.
 
This place reeks of cheap.  And not in a good way like a cheap beer, the sort of thing I'll tolerate a lot for.  

Roscoe's is cheap like ""you've got to be kidding me"" cheap or ""the smell just made me throw up in my mouth"" cheap, both of which negate any benefit of cheap beer. 

Rocoe's survives on two things:  being the one gay sportsbar in town and being the one thing to do on a Tuesday night.   

So I give it a 2 out of 10.  It covers its bases, but that's it.   I'll say it a third time.

I was dressed pretty nicely but had exposed tattoos that seemed to bother her. She stared and seemed distracted, making me feel the need to explain to her that I was a good person more than once. Mind you, I was there for self esteem and anxiety issues, so feeling judged by an apathetic therapist was pretty unsettling. She didn't smile, she wasn't warm, and she wasn't encouraging.

After a good closet cleaning, I decided to bring a couple of bags of what I thought worthy down to BE. Let's see, after scrutinizing most pieces for a good 2 minutes, asking other sales associates to look things over, etc, I was able to sell five items - three with tags still attached. Guess how much ""cash"" they offered me? TEN DOLLARS. Ten dollars for FIVE items. Ten dollars for 2 dresses, 2 new tops, and 1 new belt. Are you freaking kidding me? What a rip! That means, if ten dollars is 35% of the trade, all five items will retail for a total combined cost of what, less than $35? What a total scam. Silly me was so shocked I just took my joke of a trade and left, but now I'm kicking myself for not demanding an itemized receipt to see what my items will ""really"" retail (cause they sure as hell won't only cost a combined $35).

Also, I brought in this gorgeous yellow 100% silk dress purchased at Anthro for over $100, and they said that if I dry cleaned it and brought it back (to remove 2 TINY spots on the bottom hem of the dress) they would purchase it from me - for SEVEN DOLLARS. So I'll spend $8 to dry clean it and then sell it for $7? Silly me but that just doesn't seem to add up. 

Seriously, Buffalo, stop ripping people off. You just look like a jerk. 

People, if you're not worried so much about the money aspect and are just looking for a change in wardrobe, organize a Frock Swap with a huge group of friends.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.",review,1,HY9qpAamqLXFoa7xMwNntg

Whatever, the reason, restaurants count on sites such as restaurants.com to bring in people to their establishments. We upheld our end of the agreement - we went in, ordered more  than just the 2 entree min (app, salad, corakge fee) but CDT did not uphold their end of the agreement - and in my opnion, that is horrible customer service. The certificate was supposed  to be good for a year - it's not like we tried  to use it close to the expiration date, I tried using it one month after purchasing it.

For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced. 

- Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish. 
- Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust.
- Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25.
- Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar. 
- Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil.
- Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them.
- Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic.
- Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.

I'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave. I cannot recommend Coup Des Tartes to anyone. The restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth, figuratively.

Service is mediocre. If you read the menu you will see at the bottom that they will not split checks for a table and a few other will not rules! Come on people, how tacky and inhospitable can a eatery be!? My waitress was some young girl. She was okay but obviously not to experienced. 

My food, left me dumb founded! I was having lunch. I ordered the steak fajita $11. It was a big meal with rice, beans, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, the fajita had lots of colorful peppers w/ onions and mushrooms! Never have I had mushrooms in a meat fajita, but okay I'll go with it. Then I bit into something that set my mouth a blaze! But beyond all that the food was SALTY! Yes the rice and beans as well! I could not eat it. I set there contemplating my hunger, what set before on the plates and the girth of my waist size, or to doggy bag it for my hound - I was ready to walk away when the waitress showed up and noticed my plate. When presented with the idea of a to go box, I broke down and told her it was to salty. She kindly offered to get me something else. Off the top of my head I said a chicken enchilada. It came out, and it was even worst! When asked if it was to my pleasing, I told a bold face lie! I said it was better, only meaning it was not as salty. Then I asked for a small sour cream, to cover the taste up in an attempt to make it look like I had eaten more of it then I intended. I picked at it but left more than half of it on the plate along with the sour cream (2 Tablespoons) that they charged me $2 for! 
I wanted a Sangria but opt not to attempt that recipe after experiencing the kitchen's recipes. Besides $7 for a glass of Sangria was a bit steep in my mind as well. 

If you know me, you will soon learn I love a happy hour. I read their happy hour brochure and was not impressed. Basically half price on chips & two different dips and $5 drink specials. I'll pass on this as well.

I have been to the Long Wongs in Tempe, so my boyfriend and I thought of stopping by here, we wanted to watch the championship game and we needed a place quick. We go in wanting some drinks, well the bar was closed...fine, we went and sat at a table a couple feet from a tv, perfect! We asked what draft beers they had and she said they had Bud Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser, so my boyfriend ordered a coors and i got vodka cranberry, she brought over a bottle of coors light and I walked over to the bar and looked at their tap handles and they also had Shocktop and Sierra Nevada on tap as well. Servers clearly do not know what they even have here.
After waiting for about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we finally got it and then 10 minutes later we got our two burgers.
We had no napkins and when we were looking for our server who seemed to be non-existent all night we saw her talking with the manager behind a wall, after staring at them for a few minutes he finally noticed and sent her to come check on us for the first time the whole meal.
Over all just awful service, our server did not know about food or drinks and on top of it could barely communicate with us. 

We were there to watch a game along with two other tables of five guys each who were clearly watching the championship and cheering loudly. After about 15 minutes while trying to figure out why I could barely hear the game I realized they had TV on a news channel right behind the counter, and the server & manager were also playing music from a jukebox on the other side of the restaurant in the ""closed"" bar so loudly I couldn't make out any distinct audio and once we asked why there was music playing she replied ""oh we're listening to music.""

My boyfriend and I both have been working in the industry for years and we are completely understandable of a busy restaurant and things taking a few minutes. There were TWO other tables in there and our server was seen 2 times, our food took forever, and the burgers were not worth it at all. We finally got the check and payed and left, we wrote a small note about how the service was awful (we wanted to talk to the manager but he was too busy trying to get it in clearly) and this is where it gets so much better. We left and saw him walk outside, but we were already on the main street so we called and told him about the situation, he asked us ""Yes, was there a problem?"" We told him about everything, the service, her not being knowledgable of any of her surroundings or her menu, and he replied ""oh...okay""

I had made purchases and awaited assistance from the ""manager"" in regards to a defected item. While I waited an associate approached me. I told her I was awaiting a managers assistance. I then told her the item I wanted to purchase was defected. Instead of checking another store for the item. She told me 10% off. Then I told her I would wait for the manager. She SLAMMED the item on the counter and said the manager will tell me the same. At this point I could not believe the hostility towards a customer. I waited for the manager, Katie. I told Katie about my experience with the associate. Katie then told me okay, without apologizing for the experience I just encountered. I then proceeded to locate a corporate number. Katie then approached me with the stores number. I cannot tolerate this service. 

The employees here definitely do not want to be there. They should have the proper training. 

I could not believe that the manager's actions were just like the associate. Extremely rude.

It's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central Phoenix, and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food, so I shop here occasionally, and I always leave crabby.

Every section is tiny and understocked. If something at another Michaels catches your eye, but you postpone buying it, and you figure, oh, you'll pick it up at this one because you're here... no, you won't. Wood trim, wood embellishments, specific acrylic paint colors, specific scrapbook paper designs, the edgiest floral items... forget it. This Michaels will not carry that. The staff will explain, with varying levels of chagrin, that ""this is the smallest Michaels in the region.""

That much is obvious. It's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles. 

The major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of Walmart. It has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue. 

There was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced Martha Stewart acrylic paints, which are at least interesting colors. But I'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that, chain-wide, acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level. Let me give you a hint, gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children. Nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among Munchkins. Your acrylic paint buyers are adults, which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall, and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing, our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary.

If you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.

Wow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.

Just 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.

So we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....

Orders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.

Chicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.

BBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.
 
The food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. 

It is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.

Go grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place.

Its jam packed, you can't hear the person in front of you, you're thinking, when's the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans. 

Its hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that true texas experience?

So you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you're at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.

The okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.

Hey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.

Now your entree comes, but the waitress, if you're lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!

Oh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!

So you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink.

My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.

Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  

We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates.

First time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren't any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed. 

Seeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!

Their Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn't bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well. 

I really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits?

The noise level was too high, but we had so much time invested already that we decided to stay. 
My salad consisted of a mountain of lettuce on a plate that was too small for it. As I ate, bits fell off my plate no matter how careful I was. I gleaned so many pieces of lettuce from the table and my lap that I built a little hillock. When the waitress came for the plate I quickly scooped up the pile with my hands and put it on top of the remainder of the lettuce on the little plate. She asked me if I wanted a box for my ""salad.""  Really. The lettuce mess was neither my fault nor hers, and I realize it is the server's job to clear the table, but it did happen on my watch so I would have felt churlish leaving it for her to clean up. She had liberally sown the floor with morsels of food fallen from over-filled plates being carried to diners, but least the hostess was constantly sweeping up the mess on the floor.
After asking whether the rib eye or the New York would be the most tender I ordered the rib eye. When it came it took a monumental effort to cut it. I am strong, so I managed to hack off a couple of bites and finally complained that it was too tough. I was scolded for not ordering a filet in the first place and was asked if I would rather have that. It was a clumsy job of upselling, but I agreed to try one. As I waited for it to be cooked I couldn't keep from staring in morbid fascination at the ocean of gravy sloshing over the gunnel of the overfilled plate across from me. The so-called filet finally came and had the stringy texture of tenderized meat, not the buttery texture of a good filet, and it would have been a nice touch to comp me the difference between the rib eye and the filet, but I was charged the difference. The time to recommend the filet would have been when I first asked about tenderness, not after I had wrestled with the tough rib eye.

A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month, and ask me to go there with him today.  He said on his previous visit, he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed.  His assessment was quite accurate.

The first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round, as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor, and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen?  The first bite discloses the sad news:  the meat is tasteless, rubbery, and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years.  Astonishingly, you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger.  My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen.    

We had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that ""oriental owners"" had taken over.  The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars.  

It's quite sad.  This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charm...and hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town.

a lady from this 7 person office calls me in reference to a service that was schedule between 1-4 pm , this was per the property manager.. However there was a miscommunication between the business and the manager all I knew was it was between 1pm to 4pm.
i was on my way to the house to take care of the issue .. Before i forget to mention this ... 
A lady calls me at 12:50 asking me how far was I from the home ... i answered give me 15 minutes (I was still thinking about the 1-4pm time slot) she then said you know this is not going to happen , the property manger this the property manager that ... this is ridiculous and you guys should've been there and went on and on and on and on ... and she was on my cars bluetooth on blast with my 11 and 9 year.... and  i said well i apologize for that i will there as soon as possible.. then she said .. no... its not going to happen ma'am not today ... this is not going to happen ma'am .. she uses the word ma'am like she was to say *insert profanity here* , then i asked how can we resolve this maybe  if we can work on rescheduling (first of all WHY am I as the consumer would be trying to make things work when she was standoffish to begin with? IDK maybe i am still hoping for world peace) ... and she was like ugh no I need to call American Home Shield and the owner I don't know this is ridiculous.. and I asked well can we get a time maybe for next week and then call us if its possible or not and she NO MA'AM I AM NOT GOING TO THAT all loud ..... and asked ... excuse me did I say something to offend you???  and here goes........SHE HUNG UP! i called back and she said YES I HUNG UP ON YOU and hung up again !

I was disappointed with the property manager and made sure he knew I felt, however Angry lady's action was uncalled for... wow ,now i know why some people pay a premium for larger companies ... since this will not be tolerated.


When i read the review from Mollie C .... why am I not surprised?

1) filed an executive complaint with the BBB
2) a copy was sent to American Home Shield and the FTC , just in case this company tries to make a quick buck....and ask for the $75 deductible

The second time around, it was pretty horrendous.  My boyfriend and I were driving around trying to find a place on which we could both agree.  I was craving sushi, and he's not crazy about sushi.  Ultimately, Moto came to my mind--because they have some basic sushi rolls (although no raw salmon or really much raw nigiri to speak of) along with lots of other food. 

So, Moto it was.  On arrival, as we walked up, we noticed a couple of empty tables inside so we weren't too worried about having to wait.  But, when we got inside, the host basically just pointed at a table at the bar, had us sit down, and then threw two menus onto the table and walked away. 

As we sat at a table in the bar area--although we wanted to eat in the actual restaurant area--my boyfriend immediately noticed that the couple sitting behind us was completely hammered.  I listened for a moment, and indeed, they were screaming.  Screaming their conversation.  And they were discussing herpes sores.  They appeared to be on a date, discussing herpes sores, and the female occasionally mentioned her DAUGHTER.  

So after listening to some loud herpes convo for a few moments, my boyfriend went and asked the host if they had a different table, inside the actual restaurant portion.  We were added to a list.  

About 5 minutes later, a waitress approached, and I'm 99.9% sure that she was intoxicated.  Not just slightly inebriated, either, but kind of ridiculous drunk.  She looked all glazed over as she asked if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if they had a drink menu and she stared at me like she was really confused.  Then I asked if they had a cocktail menu, and she said, no, we have a menu of beer and wine.  She gave me a weird look.  So, thinking I was mistaken about the drink situation, I asked, do you guys have a full bar? 

She said, oh, yes!  What do you like!?!?  I like fruity drinks, so I asked if they had Stoli Razzberri (or however it's spelled).  She said, ""I LOVE THAT.  THAT'S MY FAVORITE.""  Then she informed me that she wasn't sure if they had it, but she would check.  My boyfriend (who was driving) requested a water, and the waitress walked away. 

Eventually after enduring more conversation about that chick's kid and various human ailments (herpes, chicken pox, the flu), the host told us they had a table for us.  He walked us to the table and threw menus on it.  As he started to walk away, I mentioned to him that I had ordered a drink from the waitress at the other table and I didn't want her to wonder where we went.  He said he'd already told her about it, and not to worry.  A few seconds later, he brought the drink over and set it down.  Oddly, the drink was pink, and a Stoli Razz & tonic isn't usually pink.  But I figured it looked interesting so I'd give it a shot anyway.  

Shortly thereafter, our actual waitress approached.  She immediately started LECTURING us about how we can't just order drinks at the bar and walk away without cashing out at the bar.  She went on for a while about how we needed to go back and cash out at the bar.  We explained that we never meant to sit at the bar, and that we had just gotten our drink at our actual table, and hadn't received it at the bar.  So then she kind of backed off after saying something weird, like, ""Oh, so you just got them?  Oh, okay, then you guys aren't too worried about it then I guess.""  Then she started telling me about the drink I'd received, which wasn't the one that I ordered--it was some other type of vodka with actual fruit in it or something.  Then she gave me a long list of all the other types of fruit vodkas that they have.  I guess that was ok, and the drink ended up being pretty decent.  But it was still just....bizarre. 

Anyway, we ordered our food.  That included a shrimp tempura roll, a squid salad, a regular sized order of the asian nachos, and a buffalo burger.  

The shrimp tempura roll and squid salad came out first.  I'm an idiot who's terrible with chopsticks, and I didn't notice that we had no forks until the waitress was gone.  It took a while to obtain a fork.  But anyhow, the squid salad was pretty decent, typical for any sushi restaurant.  The roll was....ok.  The crab mix in it was kind of like what you could get in a crab salad sandwich at Subway.  It also had carrots in it, which were kind of overwhelming.  

Then, out came the asian nachos.  The gigantic asian nachos.  She brought us a large instead of the regular that I ordered, and of course, charged us for the large.  I considered saying something, but I figured we'd just get a lecture.  We were only able to finish a small portion of them, because the large was freaking huge.  Fortunately they were good.  

Maybe we misread, but the buffalo burger was made with buffalo, not buffalo sauce.

I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she ""needs a minute to move the table"" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. 

Star removal #1.

We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?

Star removal #2.

We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. 

Star removal #3.

They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.

Star Removal #4

I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that ""We can grat anyone we want"" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.

Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.

P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours.

Sloppy presentation and rice was super tacky to the point of staleness.  Decided not to buy any more rolls since they failed the first two tester rolls.  If you cannot make a spicy tuna roll you have no business calling yourself a sushi place.  Pad Thai sounded yummy and ordered chicken added to the dish.  We were going to forgive the rolls since we can be a little snooty about sushi, but shouldn't you be?  Its not like you ordered anything cheap.  After two bites into the Pad Thai I bit into a bone! Mmm...wasnt expecting that!  I spit out the bone and looked through the Pad Thai to find three bone shards in the noodles.  Wanting to bring it to the attention of the management, cause I would want to know if it were my place if bone fragements were being served by accident to my patrons, we waited 15 mins to be told that they would make us another dish.  Aftering waiting for so long, the appetite for this place was gone and we asked if they could just remove the item from the bill.  The manager said,""Of course, sorry.""  No big deal until we got the bill and only the additional charge for chicken was removed from the bill.  Asking to speak to the manager again since we were told the entree was going to be removed we were told, ""I took the chicken off since that is what you had a problem with and everyone know that is the risk you take when eating chicken, cuz chicken's have bones.""

Why are you trying to say I bought the stool NEXT to mine when I already showed you the price tag for MY stool and you rang me up already? You see, the one NEXT to mine still has it's price tag attached. If I were trying to buy that one..well..your cashier would have it in his hand. We debate back and forth. I question him, if the signs were shuffled around why would there be two price signs for the stool NEXT to mine?  You see each stool already has its own price tag correctly attached as you just reviewed each one. He's stoic. Well, what's the price then? Hmm.. he doesn't know and he goes back to look it up. Turns out it is $50. I don't understand. An associate was just working with me and confirmed that $30 was the price. 

Manager is adamant that customers probably just moved the signs around. I pointed around the furniture displays. Okay. Where is the $50 sign then? Was it shuffled around? Nope. No $50 sign anywhere. Just 4 stools, 4 price tags all at $30. My stool had a $30 sign, I brought it up front, paid for it and you are saying that this was a signage error? Your sales staff didn't seem to notice.

I guess I am an optimist.  I really want to think they would improve their customer service over the years but sadly they have not.  From their cashiers (who are so freakin' slow and why is it there is only one ringing people up), to their less than pleasant makeup artists (unskilled and unknowledgeable about the cosmetics carried at their store compounded with inability to apply makeup).   Let me entertain you and share my most recent adventure.

As I enter the only Ulta in metro-Phoenix, I'm not greeted, and there's at least 3 sales clerks/wanna-be makeup artists I encounter as I walk thru the store to the back where they carry all the hair products.  After picking up my favorite shampoo, I decide to wander into the cosmetics department to see what's new.  One of the sales clerks (who ignored me when I entered) slowly comes up to me, notably not really wanting to help me but I guess she felt that she needed to at least ""try"" to seem like she wanted to sell cosmetics.   I play along and ask her about new shadows and blushes and what she recommends.  Since Ulta has very competitive brands, she is very politically-correct by informing me they are all wonderful.  Whatever.  Do you have an opinion?  Maybe some follow-up questions like ""What are you looking for in a product?""  ""What products do you currently use?""   Like every time before, I leave the cosmetics department empty-handed.  I'm not the typical customer that will buy a set because it comes with a little bit of everything.  That's borderline hoarding and I don't dig it.  Show me a product that works, and I'll buy it.  Give me great customer service, and I'll buy a bunch.  Simple as that people.  I'm a sucker for great customer service and will spend a lot of $$.  Ask my spouse.

So I make my way to the long line.  Long because there's only one cashier who is dealing with a disappointed customer.  Am I surprised?  No.  Am I reconsidering where I buy from the next time? Absolutely.   The customers in front and behind me are clearly just as frustrated as I.  One lady mentions, ""This is why I buy online!""  I totally agree.  So I finally make it to the cashier who doesn't greet me, just tries to sell me more magazines than I need.  I respectfully decline.  She rings up my purchases and literally throws them in a small bag.  By the time she squishes all my products in the little bag, it's bursting at the seams.  I give her my coupon (20% off my entire purchase which is the only reason why I went to Ulta in the first place) and with disdain, she runs it and makes sure she rips it into teeny tiny pieces in front of me.  What is she trying to say?  You'll never see this coupon again?  Whatever, get over yourself.  

So long story short, Uta sucks.  Especially the one at the Esplanade.  It's such a shame.  Ulta is in the business of selling beauty products and helping its customers look and feel better about themselves, which they clearly do not.  I've tried to avoid the Ulta at the Esplanade, but I have to say even the one in Ahwatukee and Chandler are almost as bad.  I get better customer service at Walmart.  That's how bad Ulta is.

She introduced me to Italian beef and is a native of Chicago. We first visited one of the two in Tucson and then alternated between the three -now one left--in the Phoenix area. We normally split an Italian beef; extra beef, cheese, sweet peppers, dipped; two extra crispy fries and an order of their homemade, batter dipped, onion rings. The food is awesome and I've had many of the items on the menu. The down side is the service. Now, I don't need the staff to be all happy and smiley but politeness and customer oriented I do expect. The owner and employees seem to be bothered by customers coming in to order food. A son of the owner of the Phoenix area restaurant(s) ran a place in Chandler, it was very nice and consistently packed with a  steady flow of customers and pleasantries from the staff. Not sure why papa didn't want junior to succeed, especially when his old man and brother own the two in Tucson. Seems you would want this to keep going with the family and be proud of a the legacy.  Anyway the Chandler store was closed without a word to the steady customer they knew by name and order. Then the same thing happened to the Scottsdale location. Showed up one Saturday and the place is empty and up for lease.

I just moved to Phoenix from the Windy City in January and I had a hankering for an Italian Beef sandwich.  I started to try out Rosati's which is closer to where I live, but decided I'd yelp first to see what options I had.  Luke's was one of the more popular recommendations.  I stopped by this evening and there was a group of ladies in front of me.  I took a moment to look at the menu, but I already knew what I wanted- mostly just filling the time until the guy at the counter was ready to take my order.  As the girls took to their seats, I was expecting the guy to greet me or ask me what I was having. Not everyone's big on small talk.  I get it.  Welp, the guy walked past me and avoided eye contact, heading into the back.  I waited at the counter, and he came back out within seconds... And walked right past me again.  He was apparently getting some cups for the ladies who were in line before me.  A simple ""I'll be with you in a minute"" would do.  None offered.  So I finally place my order and give the guy my credit card.  He swipes it and sits it on the counter and walks into the back again.  I wasn't sure if he'd actually collected the payment or what, so I left it there.  He comes back out and is shuffling around a bit, finally noticing that my card is still on the counter, then asks me if it's mine.  Then he remembers that I still need to sign off on the receipt.  I get my food, and leave.  Bad service, I'm hoping the food at least makes up for it.  

When I get home, I can't wait to dig into my Italian Beef.  Oh boy!  It was dry and the beef tasted like it had been re-cooked.  People, I'm from Chicago.  You can get this quality of Italian Beef from any hole-in-the-wall place in the city.  Thing is, it'll be about $4.

I already felt weird meeting my date at a 50s diner, being black, because back then blks/whts didn't even sit together, but I quickly got over that LOL

The design of the restaurant is pretty neat, a pink trailer. & inside, the booths are pretty retro. The menu is more extensive than one might think. I was overwhelmed by the choices.

I went with lunch during breakfast time. Ordered a chicken fried chicken w/mashed potatoes and a bowl of fruit.

I ordered apple juice, at first they told me the machine was broken so I took cranberry juice as a substitute but before I could drink that, they brought me the apple juice and swiftly took the cranberry away. This was odd to me because if the cranberry juice is already poured, and I've put my straw in it, are you just taking it and throwing it down the sink? & if you're doing that, you should just leave it for me, but whatever I was happy they had the apple juice.

The waitresses that I encountered were nice enough. I was glad they had some color in the establishment, just makes me feel more comfortable (hispanic-descent waitress).

My order came, just as I ordered it and it looked good. I always start with my fruit, as I'm eating it and enjoying it, I get to a cantaloupe piece and WHOOMP! There It Is!!

By this time, we'd both enjoyed some sips of our drinks and our food had just been delivered and he was waiting on some butter for his pancakes.

I've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.

There were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.

When the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a ""hot"" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It's gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won't soon forget.

When we told the waitress that ""tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess"".  Her response was ""It is for me too"".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!

Enter the ""Manager"".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.

If any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).

Ready for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what's coming next.... What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!

In closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!

First of all, I have celiac or in lamens terms, I can't eat anything with gluten (wheat, oats, rye, barley) in it. So here I am at this kinda cute (kinda dumpy) diner with my boyfriend and I ask to see the allergen menu. So they come out with a packet with like 8 point font after a about a long wait, lovely. Then, our server takes about 15 minutes to ask us what we want...I ordered my meal, and substituded mashed potatoes for a side in order to keep gluten free. Just to be sure however, I asked our server if the potatoes are freshly made, she said YES. 
Well, I eat one bite of mashed potatoes and minutes later I am sick. So I went to the front to ask somebody, and three of the staff members sit there and argue about wether or not the potatoes are fresh and the kitchen is literally RIGHT BEHIND THEM! Hello, just turn around and ask! 
Finally, as I'm about to puke (sorry if that's TMI) one of them says ""there's our manager go ask her."" Uh, rude. So I do and she informs me that they are in fact not freshly made, they come in a package and probably do contain wheat contrary to the gluten free menu. So of course, my boyfriend and I pack up our food really quick, I tell her they basically just poisoned me and her response was to pay at the front. Awesome. Needless to say I will not be going back there ever again.

After clear request for hard eggs in benedict, 15 minutes goes by, eggs come out hard, but wrong benedict. PLEASE, just quickly scrape out beef and replace with fish, another 15 minutes goes by and monstrosity arrives. Clearly they re-did the muffin and fish, but same (now cold) hash browns, hollandaise (topped with a bit of new), same eggs (also cold). Complain, manager (hispanic lady) says, 'sorry, we tried'. I say the plate is an embarrasment, if you were going to take 15 minutes, you could have at least re-made whole plate. She insists they did, I ask how they managed to cut her hard eggs just like she did, layer new holly over old stuff, she insists they remade it.

Restaurants screw up. Turns out waitress entered wrong model of benny, despite pleading with her to be careful. The mistake is sloppily fixed, but takes 15 minutes and they can't bother to replace 75 cents worth of hash browns and eggs. 

Complain to the manager, all you get is a defiant 'sorry, we tried', and absolute BS they ""remade it all"". No discount, no nothing. They did correct the price of the wrong dish choice. Big deal.

5 and Diner is a diner, I don't expect 5 stars. But I don't like being lied to, particularly when the evidence is so obvious.

Maybe I'm a food snob, but this was some of the worst breakfast food I've ever had.  I ordered an Eggs Benedict, and the sauce over it was frankly inedible.

This place has two things going for it:  an incredible nostalgic setting/rooms, and good to great service.  Both of those are 5 stars.

PERFECT!  3 eggs, over medium, and I mean they were perfectly cooked ""medium"", best hashed browns I've had since the Aristocrat in Boulder, awesome!

Went back two weeks ago, ordered the same the same menu; the food came up so quickly, it had to have been just sitting there, an overcook, whatever, it wasn't ""fresh"".  I know this much for sure: it wasn't nearly as good as the first visit.

Today, a late breakfast, I enter about 10:55am and I get the last table.  Now, I've been in the restaurant business and when the hostess fucking apologizes to the waitress for sitting the single patron at the last table, I'm already a little pissed.

I tell the server I heard that comment and ""...I'll TRY to be a good little patron"", kiss my ass.  I order right away, so probably close to 11:00am.  At 11:36, I give her a HUGE EYE-ROLL, ""where is my food"" and she say's she'll check.    She'll check?

[I want to take a moment to talk about CONSISTENCY.  If a restaurant is so prompt so as to have served me almost instantly on my prior visit, you cannot justify a 36-minute PLUS wait for any reason.  More on the ""reason"" why the order was so late in a moment]

I said, ""no thank you.  Allow me to pay for the coffee and OJ and I'll be on my way"".  The server was nice, mgt said no chg for the beverages -- thank you and there shouldn't have been a chg -- I even said to her, ""It's not your fault.  I have no cash, I'll come back with a tip.""  Which I would have done had she not said, ""...it was the 'extra crispy' on the hashed browns.""  In other words, my order was 20 minutes late because I wanted extra crispy hashed browns.

Now, one might suspect that, well, you lived there five years, you must've loved it!  Oh nay, my friends.  Nay.

I lived there at first, because it was honestly the cheapest place I could find that was in a decent location.  I then was locked into lease agreements I couldn't get out of unless I paid up the wazoo. I will say, being just two minutes from The Biltmore IS quite nice.  However, the apartments themselves... absolutely dreadful.  

In the time I lived there, the management changed hands at LEAST once... perhaps twice.  Anyway, when a change was made, somehow, for some reason, the prices raised as well.  Surprising, as no changes were made to ANY part of ANY apartment home, in ANY section of the complex.  But, I digress...

The place in infested.  I found tons of cockroaches, and finally in the middle of one night, a scorpion.  THAT about did it for me.  And even after numerous phone calls, letters, visiting personally, etc. to tell management about the infestation problems, I NEVER got responses, and the issues were NEVER addressed.  

THEN there's the whole matter of the air conditioning... see, they control when, during the year, you may USE your air conditioning.  And they don't like to let you use it for some reason.  So when it reaches temps of over 90 degrees in late March/early April, which, by the way, means it gets to over 100 degrees INSIDE the apartment, and you complain and complain and complain about it being unfit to reside in... you are not responded to directly.  Instead, they attach a note to everyone's door saying ""we're happy to report you can use your air conditioning in 2-4 weeks!"" ...REALLY??

In addition to THAT!... once able to use said air conditioning, it started leaking, causing water damage to the ceiling, and causing me to have to use a bucket to catch the river of water falling from the ceiling.  After calling their ""emergency"" line numerous times, I would get someone to show up and ""fix"" it.  About a week later, it would start again.  Same procedure.  That probably happened 8 times within 4 months.  By the time I moved out, it still wasn't fixed.  Even after they cut a hole in the ceiling (which they forgot about as the hole was still there three weeks later and I had to physically go to the office and tell them the work wasn't finished), then patched it with ""new"" ceiling... still leaked.  Still had water damage.

Then there's the plumbing.  The kitchen sink would, approximately every 3 months, start to flood and back up into my kitchen.  Mind you, I am a single girl.  Who barely even USES any appliances in her kitchen.  And there would be rotten food that backed up that I had never HAD in my kitchen to begin with... the pipe was connected with the apartment next door.  It was disgusting. This happened so many times, I began to start all my phone conversations/messages to them with ""it's me again!""

The management is slow, rude, uncaring, and only out to squeeze every red cent from you they possibly can.  They're probably STILL after me to pay something.  This is THE worst possible place anyone can live.  It's shameful.  This place makes me physically angry.  But I did learn something from them.  You have to watch out for yourself.

We were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.

I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with sautéed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.

The salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.

When my entrée showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).

The sautéed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love sautéed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been sautéed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).

Although the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star.",review,0,D8TlrpLhMPPdgS21HeYObQ

I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. 

This review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. 

Like I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. 

The washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently ""broke down"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to ""resolve"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.

But, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. 
I called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. 

I then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final ""pulled strings"" to ""accommodate"" my original delivery request. 
But...it's not over yet. 

The second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. 

I don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. 

So my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it.

I took my computer to Best Buy to get it recycled.  Computer parts are super toxic and should NOT be thrown into the trash.  They wanted to charge me $10 to recycle it.  Someone step out there and pass a dammed law saying that recycling charges must be included in purchases, for the love of god.  It doesn't take a genius to determine cause-and-effect incentive structures and figure this out.  Oh, tangent.

But I didn't have to pay $10, because they were going to charge me $20 to remove my harddrive, and that apparently trumps the recycling charge.  $20.  TWENTY.  It's 4 screws.  That's it.  That's $5 per screw.  I asked him if i could just borrow a screwdriver and I'd do it right there.  He said no.  So I went to try and find a screwdriver for purchase in the store.

I start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section.
nope.
Maybe around by the video cameras.
Nope nope.
Under a display cabinet?
Nah,that would be silly...
They were just gone.
Poofed.
Vanished.
Vaporized.
I decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens.
Yes,I said ""nefarious"".
I became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's.
Who would protect me?
The aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me.
I couldn't possibly stop them all.
They would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me.
I would be defenseless.
Fearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices.
1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization.
2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me.
3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera.
Gentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3.
New camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive.
Since all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve.

First off, the oil leak was ""repaired"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  

So, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my ""service engine"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my ""service engine"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.

Now, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.

I would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.

Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. 

Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! 

Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! 

I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. 

You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. 

There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...

I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. 

I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. 

Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? 

I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? 

The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! 

Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. 

I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. 

I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! 

Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? 
NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food.

When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.

When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.

I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue, my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty.

My partner and I live in Central Phoenix and had friends from San Diego in for a visit last weekend.  After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great cafés in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.

I peeked through the front window because the flat irons were on a display facing the window so I figured I'd window browse until they opened. At 11:03 the brunette ""manager"" (she was pretty young) started unlocking the doors for the employee who had just arrived, smoking a cigarette on her way in the door. Then the same manager opened up the gates on the windows and walked away. I tried to make eye contact with her because it appeared that the gate opening signalled they were open and I wanted the go-ahead to enter but she refused to look at me. So finally I just opened the door and asked ""are you open now?"" very politely. The manager snipped ""Yes, we don't open earlier than 11. Those are the hours!"" with a frown and a white-trash attitude. I said ""okay thats fine... I just wasn't sure if you were opening the gates because it was officially open or not.. wow."" 

Now, I know how irritating the ""waiting at the window"" customer can be so I tried my best not to be that person - but was not greeted, was treated rudely and received a nasty ""welcome"" by the angry-at-life manager.

Then the employee girl and manager started talking together about going out to clubs, about how they were 30 dollars short on the till the day before because they counted it too fast the night before because they wanted to ""get out of here and go out!"" and other inappropriate conversation. The employee did her best to be polite and helpful, but it was clear she had never been trained on proper customer service (probably because her manager is so awful).

I ended up buying the flat iron thanks to the help of the employee. At one point another customer tried to pay with a credit card, but the employee had to wait for the manager to get off the phone so she could use the dial-up to swipe the card. When the employee asked the manager to end the conversation so she could help the customer the manager yelled ""No just wait!"" from the back of the store. I was shocked!

Today is a Sunday so I don't know if this is the regular manager, but this relatively young brownhaired woman was like a bad joke. I won't be returning again, even if this styling iron fries up tomorrow! Not worth it!",review,6,rWFCaDU05dUelPe8gFtJvg

I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a ""hi, we'll be right with you"" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the ""Call for service"" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the ""kid"" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the ""less than educated"" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.

CVS seemed like a safe option after my insurance plan and Walgreen's parted company, but has proven to be anything but. It has now taken seven different attempts to get a simple prescription refill, one that was easily filled correctly the first time at Walgreen's with no issues. 

CVS has said it was ready when it wasn't; filled it with less medication than the prescription specifies; argued over what the prescription calls for;  told me on one visit that it was not covered in my plan without even checking; finally recognized they had not done it correctly and said they would; notified me it was ready to pick up and then called back to say oops, they needed more time to get the rest of it in; notified me that the new version was ready for pick up only to give me the old, incorrect version and  then go to the back to find the newer version of it, which I purchased, only to find they had gotten closer to being correct but had once again shorted me on the medication. 

I have cancer, and the time and energy it has taken to deal with this one prescription has been very wearing.

Anyway, back to the panhandlers. About a year ago, I was coming out of this CVS and heading to the bus stop. As I turned the corner, a guy approached me asking for money and before i could answer, he pulled out a knife. Luckily, I was able to run to the bus stop and the bus came right then. I was pretty shaken up because it was summertime and nobody was really around in that area (it was by the drive thru pharmacy). That evening, I decided to call the store and ask to speak to a manager to address their issues with people begging for money. Not only did I get an attitude, but the lady from the description of the guy that I gave her, seemed to know exactly who this person was (described him as a regular customer). She defended him by saying that it didn't sound like something he'd do. Um, excuse me? I was able to give her the exact time according to her that he is around CVS, a description, etc. Why would I lie about this?

When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. 

So, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place.

I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning, so apparently it takes them 3 days to send my laptop from downtown Phx to downtown Tempe. The next day I got a call saying they basically have no clue what the issue is but that they are going to reinstall windows and see if that takes care of the problem. That will cost me an additional $200 to reinstall windows!! At this point I feel like I am trapped because I have already spent $100 bucks and they have the computer. I reluctantly agree to basically pay $300 to have windows reinstalled in my 2 year old laptop. When will I get it back? How long could that possibly take, right? Well, 3-5 days he says. it will take 3-5 days to reinstall windows into my laptop and that is ""putting it ahead of 30 other computers for me."" The guy is now acting like I should feel lucky that he is putting mine ahead of others because otherwise it could take 2 WEEKS?! 2 days later I get a call that it is done and seems to be working just fine. It will be back in the Phoenix store for me to pick up 2 1/2 days later...
Finally, I get my computer back after 2 weeks and $300. Oh well, at least it is all fixed now, right? WRONG. Now my computer will not connect to my wireless network at home. So I call and talk to my wireless provider for 35 minutes trying this and that and she determines it is my computer that has a problem, not the service. I knew that because the other 4 laptops in the house work fine but I figured maybe it just needed to be reset-up or something. 
I called the Data Doctors store to ask them to help me over the phone with maybe a setting or two. The location I dropped it off at originally has NO RECORD of my laptop ever even coming thru that store and they refer me to call the Tempe lab. I call the Tempe lab and tell two different people my issue before someone decides to help me. They tap into my computer from the lab and look at a few things for 10 minutes and then tell me he thinks it is my wireless connection!! I explain that I have several other computers in the house and that I never had an issue with the wireless component until I got it back from them. He says he does not think it is the computer but I have to take it back to the store to have them try to connect it to their wireless network and go from there...but he does not think it is the computer itself.

Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service, in a blatant word - SUCKS.  First, they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners.  That car washing cost me nearly $300.  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.  

Then, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.  

But, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was ""For Sale"" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was ""No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of.""  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!   

I know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.

This review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road, but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the years.

I lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California.  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice.  In the mid-nineties, the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart.  I had noticed Danny's all over town, and decided to give them a try.

They were spectacular in those early years.  I got great service, everyone was friendly, and you didn't have those annoying ""how about a detail, oil change, upgrade to first class"" upselling as you drove up.  You chose, you paid, you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up nice.

Then somebody got greedy...  At first, there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff, sometimes two-to-three times.  I fended them off at first, but they became so persistent that I complained, and well, I got a bewildered ""it's our right to make money"" attitude from them, so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperate.

Cut to the present.  I came back this last weekend to visit family, and my volvo wagon was a mess.  Kid, dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month.  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by.  Bought the ""Royal"" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux.  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other side.

Well, after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes, I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done.  Or at least to their standards.

But not mine, oh heaven's no.  There was still bird poo on the roof.  When I pointed this out, the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag.  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away, he just shrugged his shoulders.

We were in  a hurry at this point, so we just got in and sped off.  But wait, there's more.  While we were driving back to the house, we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any ""not so hard to reach"" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats.  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies, but there was still TRASH in some of the places.  

Looking around more, I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been ""protected"" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors, the dash top, and that's about it.  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean, and the back seats were still dry as a bone.  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome.  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble Telescope.

But they are totally phoning in the work on the family car.  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater, but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have.  I still feel it should get the same attention, especially at $30.",review,5,eZ4ISr7SJzLFSELjFUGhBQ

Yes, you'd think that would be a good thing.  But there were literally 3 cars ahead of mine in the row it was in.  This place is based on pushing cars through, NOT cleaning them.

They did nothing more than smear their cheap version of armor-all on the tires and wash the windows.  This is VIP?  What a joke.

They wrote on the car window, ""basic wash"" and it did not come off after the wash.

The price started high, then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined. Finally came down to the ""I give you good deal if you do it now, includes complete interior and exterior wash, engine clean, and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork"".

I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal, but apparently since he hadn't circled it, it wasn't really included.

After drying it off, another guy got in to park it. He was driving my car hard like a race car...just like the young man before him.

The last two times I have been at the Highland Avenue location I have had poor service. Today was (again) a poor experience. Even after specifically asking that they clean the bugs off the front end (assuming they would do the rest of car without being asked) I still had to ask (again) at the end to please wipe off the bugs.  Last time the car did not even looked like it had been washed.  Just the top/superficial dirt was removed. 

The attitude of the workers is that they are doing me a big favour by wiping off my car - and I always tip when they are finished so it's not like I am being overly picky. Additionally - when you have three or four workers all speaking Spanish and all of them looking at me, snickering, pointing at the car and then looking at me, laughing and the young lady actually rolling her eyes; well being rude to the customer and not making me feel welcome when the car was not clean is inexcusable.

It was just after 8:45 this morning that I was there.  You were NOT busy - there was not a big line and you had plenty of workers in the finishing area.  Seems like 4 or 5 guys were quite happy to work on shining up a large white Humvee that was there for over 30 minutes while the (less than) 10 minutes spent on my Mariner was half-hearted and sloppy. The mirror inside was dirty and pushed all the way to one side - I thought the idea was to put the mirror back in an approximation of where it was when the customer gets back in? Both seats in front were moved and the passenger seat was wet. The center console area had not even been cursorily wiped, and the areas inside all the door and windows was filthy and looked to have never even been touched,.  This is the same sloppy work the last time I was there.

I have had to ask a couple of times in the past to get the car wiped down better -- 18 dollars and I cannot even get a clean car? Lately there seems to be no one outside managing the lines or workers. I pull in -- no one bothers to look up or point me to the lane they want me in.  Someone else pulls up after me and they get waved into another lane and serviced before me. 

I specifically ask that the front end is wiped down and all the bugs are removed. The young man checking me in assures me this will be done and he writes a note on the window. I do not stand out there and watch every move they make - I assume the car will get vacuumed out and then sent through.

So today:
Front end is filthy after wash and I have to ask AGAIN that they clean it
Rude and disrespectful employees laughing at me is not a good way to do business
The center console has not been wiped and still has dirt in it from when I pulled in. 
The passenger seat is wet.
The inside of all the doors sills and windows sills are filthy and have not been touched at all
The water dripping down from the door seams and from around the back window streak up the finish by the time I pull across the street to Trader Joe's. I saw them happily blowing all the water out from the Humvee - I guess no one bothered to do mine.
  
I should not have to go back AGAIN and spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for them to wash it right. They should do it the first time without me having to ask specifically.  Especially for 18 dollars.

I am extremely unhappy. I have tried to contact the management.  Let's see if anyone cares enough to email or call me back. Otherwise - do not go here. EVER.",review,4,6zHRwS6D20XUaDQ5Qiueag

I used to get my gas, oil-changes and vehicles washed here, but time and time again (chance after chance), my car was left to air dry, rims never cleaned or towel dried, forgotten about the air freshener, etc. I've even had to ask on multiple occasions to have the window writing wiped off before I drove off.

I'm a reasonable guy, but when you see a vehicle that happens to be a newer make or model take Presidence over yours (even though you paid the same) it is NOT okay. An on-sight employee gave me Heather's (Danny's Daughter) number in the Corporate office, that I ended up leaving 3 messages for, requesting a call back to bring the latter to her attention. A week later, I received a call back from the receptionist saying that she is TOO busy to return my calls. A week after that call, a random number called my phone 602-694-2244 and a man, (Brian) informed me that Danny does not want my business anymore. I was appalled and tad confused... Brian had no knowledge of my ongoing experiences. I am to this moment embarrassed for him that he would even be instructed to make such a ridiculous  call.

Are you a lady who hasn't had her fill of being talked down to or hit on by sleazy dudes today? Do you need an oil change but really can't be bothered to find out how much it will cost? Do you like overpaying for a carwash whose end result you could have paid $3 at Clean Freak to achieve? Well, sounds like you want to go to visit the total clowns at Danny's. 

I went here once about a year ago for an oil change and car wash. It took over an hour and I was really annoyed by the clumsy, gross flirting from the guy and that he forgot to give me the free car wash that came with it and how long it took them to give it to me when I pointed out that I was owed one. Don't make my mistake and go back because they happened to by close to your work and open when all other options were closed and you really need an oil change. 

First, I pulled up and waited five minutes for someone to make eye contact so I can figure out what bay to pull up to for an oil change. Seriously, if I'm not supposed to pull up to where the signs say OIL CHANGE to get one then get a sign to tell me where else to go to arrange this. Finally, I'm approached by some guy who stared at my cleavage the whole time he gave me the runaround of what costs what. Oh, you want me to pay $10 so that you CHECK--not act upon--the fluid levels in my car and check the tire pressure? Is this ridiculous upcharge only for ladies who you assume to be total dummies or are you an equal opportunity rip-off artist? 

After about five minutes of conversation, I still have no idea what an oil change costs there, only what extra fees they'd like to charge me for stuff that should be free and I'm pretty sure the employee doesn't either because he wants to be paid under the table. He told me he'd do a full service oil change if I just left $20 in the car. Like, don't exchange money with him out in the open, but leave it in the car, like he's an oil change hooker and I'm the john. I'm assuming your employer isn't keen on you not paying taxes, dude, but thanks for the offer?

I never followed up with these guys to figure out why the employee would tell me that it's $31.95 if I pay inside and $20 if I pay him by just leaving money in the car because I'd rather just stay away from these guys. I got in the car and closed the door on the employee while he was still trying to give me the hard sell because he wouldn't take no for an answer, which is every woman's dream, isn't it?

Oh, and the car wash I got last year with the oil change sucked, too.

I brought my new pre-owned baby (a 2012 bright red VW) to get her first wash here, thinking it was the ultimate deluxe treatment. I was so wrong. I didn't count exactly, but from start to finish I think there were 6 people who drove my car, and they didn't drive it with care or regard, and their clothes seemed dirty. They were tapping the brakes too hard and making me uncomfortable just watching them drive it. 

When you drive up, it is entirely unclear where to go. As a first-timer, I had no clue. A lazy guy in a Danny's uniform pointed for us to get in one lane, and then pointed to another lane, which was confusing. Then he came to the window and tried to upsell us on getting our car detailed and buffed, saying it would ""return it to new"". Buddy, it's a new car - it was washed a month ago at the dealership. When my husband politely said no, he seemed mad. We chose the VIP wash for $20 and from there it was a waiting game until our car was in the front of the giant blob that they call a line. In my opinion, it took a long time. I took my shopping bag inside with me, thank goodness I did because apparently there's been a lot of robberies there. 

After a short time through the tunnel and a half-assed rubdown from about 5 different thug-looking guys, the car was ""done"".

Approximately 45 minutes later a tech can in to tell me that my transmission fluid need to be changed or it was going to burn up.  When I told him I had it done at 65,000 mile at Mazda, the car only has 79,000 miles now, he said that they lied to me and I should go back and get my money back.  Now who should I believe, my brother of 51 years or this 23 year old kid I just met.  I told him that I would take care of the problem myself and he said again, ""it better be soon, this car might not make it much longer.""  When I went to pay expecting my bill to be around $30.00 with tax but was informed that it was $35.48.  When I asked the cashier why, she told me that the oil filter is not included in the oil change.  Who does a oil change without changing the filter?  I asked to speak with the manager he was not available.  When I told the tech that I would just pay the bill and not come here again and YELP their business, he said ""DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.""

Three best words to explain what a horrific experience I had at this Danny's for the first (and most definitely last) time this last Tuesday. I had just gotten my car back from the shop and decided to get a full interior detail done. I live right off 16th and highland so it was a convenient choice. Well boy was I the fool to think 80 bucks would get me a somewhat decently clean car....to my shock it was actually WORSE then before I went in and wasted my money. They actually took a small contained coffee stain in the back seat and somehow spread the stain all over my cloth seats, w/ some of the stain moved onto the front passenger seat!! It was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car. There was a huge soap stain on the interior windshield, spilled sticky soda stains UNTOUCHED in the drink consul and on top of all of that, they soaped up my tires randomly (I didn't even buy an exterior wash) which irritated me as I pointed out to one idiot who remarked, ""oh it's to make them look shiny"" with an imbecile grin. HELLOO!!! Why not focus on the interior and actually get it done RIGHT?!? Utterly pathetic. I am still angry w/ myself for wasting my hard earned money to this joke of a business. I was so upset I took it back and the men who worked on my car the first time were all there and just stared at me with the rudest glares. Had the guy w/ the tattoos all over his head and face redo it, who actually did a little better. It's amazing this place is still in business let alone always so busy when I drive by, must be all new-timers about to be screwed out of their money...80 dollars down the drain, for a job my two year old daughter could have done better.

I initially came in for a prepaid interior exterior detail package that included a wax. Upon my arrival I agreed to a polish add on/upsell. After retrieving my vehicle  I quickly observed that no detailing had occurred whatsoever;  the inside was still dusty, dirty and there were water stains in my passenger seat. Something shampooing the seats and carpets would have easily removed. It was then that I realized that  what I had originally paid for was not done, only the upsell job. Even that was hard to confirm since they parked my black car across the street under a tree that left it with a coat of green pollen powder all over it. I asked for a manager, Danny, who offered me two free washes and to actually detail the car when I could make it back. I declined the courtesy washes and brought my vehicle back later in the week to be completed. This time when I picked up the car, it was under one of their carports in the detailing area. A staff member gave me my keys with the interior floors and seats wet to the touch. Why would you shut the doors to a car with no way for it to ventilate when the interior is still wet? The mats?  They were wet as well on top of each other locked in the trunk. Why not put them in a dryer? Again, this made no sense. Then, to top it off I noticed that both my Armor All and Meguiar detailing wipes as well as the Ozium I put UNDER my seat were missing. These items were not trash, they were barely used. There was still dirt debris and leaves under my driver seat but they had time to steal my car care products. What a joke! I again asked for a manager to voice my frustration and in return a towel boy came out asking do I still need help with my windows.

The clerks who work here are very rude.  I walked in there needing to ship something specifically ""overnight"" and was given options that were not overnight/next day.  I was at the store at 1pm which is relatively early and before the cut off for next day.  I was assured that the shipping service I purchased was going to be next day.  

Then throughout the night I was checking the tracking number and the product had not left.  The next morning I call the store and they say that they still have the product.  I was sending a passport that needed to be at my destination by 2 days after the first day I initially tried to send it (I chose next day ""overnight"" to get it there one day before luckily).  After talking to the store over the phone and asking them why the package was not delivered, they told me I did not choose an ""overnight"" service.  The one thing that I specifically told them was that ""this needs to be sent overnight so that it will arrive tomorrow"".

Then they tried to charge me more money saying that I did not purchase an overnight product.  Which first of all, I asked specifically only for their overnight options, why would you give me an option that is not overnight. Second, even if your incompetent clerks selected a service that is not overnight, why would it still be there.  I am assuming if it's not overnight, it should still be on it's way for 2nd day and my 1 day cushion would save me.  

So I ask the clerk to tell the owner to give me a call.  The owner did not give me a call back and told the clerk, ""I will not settle the difference for this, he will pay it or I will throw it away.""  So the asshole wants to throw away the passport that I need to send because his staff sold me the incorrect service.  I specifically stated to his clerks that the package ""needed to be there by tomorrow"" and said ""overnight"" several times.  I paid a hefty premium as well for this service given that the product weights much less than 1 pound and I was there relatively early in the day.

The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger.

They played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.

They do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy.

First, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.

In the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.

After we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.

After we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.

Even though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.

We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely ""small plates"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that ""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food."" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service.

Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was ""Well it listed the chorizo on the menu""- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to ""do anything"" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days...

First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!!

Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.

I guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, ""Unique like a Brooklyn accent."" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, ""Unique, like a Brooklyn accent."")

The person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. 

After we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.

FINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.

I would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, ""Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.""

As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.

Here's what happened:
Unbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. 

Me -So how do I change my name on my account?  

Sale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?

Me - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.
So how do I go about changing my name on my account?

Sales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.

Me - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?

Sales associate - Not at the store level

Me- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....

I then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.

The woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?

I went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone. My wife is handicapped and had to go to the bathroom, they told her to walk over to the McDonalds which is about 100 yards away.
My wife got pissed and so did I, after my wife left the store I approached  a female displeased with their flip additude. When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. 
One female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.
Of course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.
I told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.
I've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.
Of course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.
The customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.
If I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.
If Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.
If I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.

I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. 

And there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that ""I am not going to make money off of you"" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.

I was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.

Fast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)

_Cold and dry humor from the owner
_Slow waitresses
_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere

It was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's.

As a huge fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I could not pass this restaurant up, as I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that Guy Fieri had recommended.  I went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).  

My friend and I started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that I used it with the Italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.

Across the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  I had the spaghetti neri.  I did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  The spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  The seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit ""fishy"", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  However, the next day, I wish I had not, I had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  I called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (Rich) told me it couldn't possibly be their food.  Since my friend and I ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, I am 100% sure it was that dish.

I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner's attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  In fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  I can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as I.

There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us.

Honestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess. 
A hot mess.
How are they staying open?
My arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade.
We split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs) 
Then we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill.
The crust was fair.
The server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth.
So for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22

The last time I had the burger it was different they swear its the same meat and everything but my taste buds don't lie. This burger was awful, maybe even freezer burnt. The huge mushroom was the best part. 

I tried the Philly cheese recently and um I really to prefer to have meat on my sandwich! This was the sorriest Philly steak ever! Barely to bites of meat all bread and not good bread either! 

Their crab cakes are awesome but the last time I got those they were under cooked and had bits of shell in them YUCK! 

Today I ordered eggs over medium and crisp bacon. I got eggs over easy and under cooked precooked bacon that was so thin you could see through! All this for 6.17! Plus tax! This is bad eggs and really bad bacon! YUCK!

Only reason we did is because we hosted a customer seminar here the next morning. However, if you like staying in your great-great-great-great grandmothers old time shack you would enjoy it.

We arrived late (around 9 pm) and the valet guys were pretty good. I don't know if you can self park the car anywhere close. Valet asked my name and spoke into his headset, but after I walked the ten feet to the front desk the clerk had no clue who I was or what I was doing there (basically no clue at all). She couldn't tell me where our event would be (I like to check out the room the night before) or if anything had arrived for us (we shipped some things).

I headed up to the room and it reeked of fresh paint. I was going to call down, but decided I would stop on my way to the fitness center. The itself was AWFUL - could have really used a good cleaning and some new wall paper.....it just looked old and beat-up. Don't ever get suckered into staying in room 827.

Headed down to front desk and asked if the room was just painted, answer was ""I don't think so"", and instead of asking if they put me in a new room that was it. Service = Horrible.

The ""newly remodeled"" fitness center was weak -- very, very small, limited free weights, tread mills/ellipticals, and old weight machines. It would be a disaster if they had a house full of people who wanted to work out. Might be a nice spot if you were over 100 years old!

Headed back up to the room and was unimpressed with the shower and bathroom. I would say it was on par with a Super 8.

Although breakfast was included in our package, I headed down early to our event. I will say the food for that was great, service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good...I also liked the free shoe shine.

It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed ""Ritz-Carlton""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a ""ritz carlton"" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah.

My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. 
The heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded ""I have it in a book."" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker ""Friendly... Love that"" because he clearly was not.
Perhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. 
When I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, ""Oh I'm sorry. She's not here."" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. 
Call me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was ""usually"" around in the morning. 
At any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees.

I've driven coast to coast 4 times, and from CA to AZ a plethora of times and have never been in a bathroom as sick as theres was. Worse part about it was the managers rude reaction. I pointed out the fact that the toilet paper was all wet, making it impossible for anyone to use it and all he did was pile up rolls on the top of the toilet. He didn't even bother asking anyone to clean up the paper droppings; being that the toilet paper was coming off in chunks there must have been at least 20 pieces of toilet paper all over the floor. 

I guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a Friday. The over priced drinks, the horrible toilet paper and the bartender tossing ice all over the bar each time he poured a drink might also have something to do with it. 

I'm just saddened that with the influx of new businesses going in across the street, improving the area, this place is going straight downhill.

Btw def didn't taste like a merlot.  Checked my credit card charges for 2 separate receipts few days later. The server gave herself more than 20% tip when I clearly put zero on one and $3 on another receipt for 3 drinks -- purposely!!! She doesn't deserve it! 

Called the manager a few days later and short story was the manager, Adam was trying to sound professional but totally sounded annoyed. Yes it's only a few dollars but the whole principle behind their service was shady to say the least. Adam said he would call back a couple days later. Nope!! One week went by and no one called me back. So guess what? I called back. Spoke with another manager, Francisco. He told me that Adam said it was an INCONVENIENCE for him to reverse the charges and that it will cost them!!!! Hahahahahaha really??!!?? You have to be kidding me! What kind of service is this!?? They're worried about a few dollars rather than their reputation??? Wow!! That really says a lot about them. He told me the only way to get credit back is to come back for a free drink. How about NO!! Why would I go back to a place that is shady? Anyway he said Adam will call me back. We will see about that. Maybe they will when they see this.

I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza. 

While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, ""Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro."" I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, ""No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!"" To which I replied, ""Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza."" To which he replied, ""Well, the new pizza will be here shortly,"" as he walked away.

I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying.

'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.

I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager ""saved"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. ""Why don't you like caraway?"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, ""I really don't like the taste."" When she asked me ""Why?"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the ""sauce"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp.

This is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.

Unless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. 

Stale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.

And then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! 

Although I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. ""Next? Bread?"" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. ""Fries?"" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. ""Drink?"" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!

Wait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.

Well I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car.

Unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.

And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. 

Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. 

I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. 

When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory.

Yesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked. 
Food and drinks were good. 
However, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, ""It's just a spill."" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle. 
The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves. 

Even worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched. 
This was weird deja vu.  

Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha. 
Overall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY!

There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. 

I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. 

The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. 

Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. 

As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much.

Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much. 

We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave. 

I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could.

Pastries arrived quickly but no coffee.  Crossants were cold and soft, not as good as crossan from Paradise cafe but twice the price. 

Halfway done my croissant I realized I had no napkin. Asked her about coffee she said that it is brewing and need to wait four more minutes.  My husband noticed that the lady behind me complained coffee was too cold and it was then microwaved. He was puzzled as the waitress told us they serve freshly brewed coffee.

 I finished my croossant and had some quiches. finally our coffee came. They were luke warm too, not as hot as from McDonalds. At this point, twenty minutes later after we sat down,  the waitress  told us if we order now she will be able to serve quickly. We were not happy.

I was super excited since my budget for the wedding is almost nothing. So I got there and was ignored for the first 3 mins then the woman told me to go put on the dress. I did so and she had me stand on the rises, told me how she would bustle it and put one in in the hem and one at the bustle point and said ""that's it, you're done."" Really? That's it. She didn't let me give her  my input, she didn't pin it all the way around to ensure it was even, nothing. She didn't even listen when i told her I wanted some of the lace at the bottom removed. She also didn't look at the bodice to see if it fit well, it does but I think it could fit a bit better.  Being stressed and in a rush I bagged up the dress and gave it to the clerk who told me I could pick it up on Oct 8th (4 days before my wedding!) and it was only Sept 16? I was told on the phone the turn around time was 7 days. I was a bit distressed by this but left it with them anyway.  I left the store and realized they hadn't quoted me a price so I went back in. They wanted $150. I told them I was quoted $15 and I only paid $100 for the dress to begin with. They didn't say anything. I left and left the dress with them. I got home and pondered their poor treatment and apparent disregard for my desires for my gown so I called them and canceled the alteration. They hadn't done anything with it yet (THANK GOD).

So, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.

When it's that time,there are 3 Houses I look to.
Hugo Boss
St.John
Ralph Lauren
Had never been in the Lauren store at Biltmore and decided to give it a whirl.
It was Sunday afternoon last week and it wasn't busy.Wasn't empty either,but not only was I not greeted by the 2 sales women at the front of the shop,in fact they both turned away from me!
As I meandered, I did see a skirt on a manniquen that I liked and wanted to try with a summer white crisp jacket also displayed on a different manniquen.
I passed by a few more salespeople who when I got near,managed to turn their backs to me or to quickly engage someone else in conversation.
Hell,I would have been happy if a security guard started paying attention to me..
I couldn't find the skirt or jacket anywhere on the racks,and went to seek out the help of the sales staff.
I walked back up to the front of the shop where the skirt was on the manniquen,in the hopes of purchasing it.You would think at this point someone would ask if they could help me.I was obviously looking for something and someone who could assist.
One of the women who turned her back to me when I walked in,saw me,I smiled,made eye contact and a bee line to her.
I started to say ""Hello"" and she again turned her back and simply walked to the back of the store!
I was a bit stunned.At first I figured I'd follow behind asking if she could help me forcing her to just deal,but I decided to not further embarrass myself.
Kind of a shame as I did want the jacket and skirt,the paring being around 700.00...
I walked over to Macy's,where they did try to assist,but only carry the casual sportswear line of Lauren,and informed me that what I was looking at could only be bought from a Lauren store.

I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the ""corporate recipe"", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their ""signature"" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away.

So there we were Sunday night in great need of sustenance. We had a choice between the new Grassroots place & this one. I saw the sign out front for their special that night, a feta burger. The lady said fine with me, I've had their chicken souvlaki & it was good. Alas we have found refuge on this long day of errands & chores.

To take the edge off I ordered a sangria. It was fine. The prices were very affordable so I didn't expect anything heavenly. Just honest food for an honest price.

The food came & looked fine. I took a bite of the burger & it was very dry. I had a few fries which were good. After seeing the Misses dissect her chicken souvlaki & placing a piece of undercooked chicken on the spare plate between us I noticed something was just not right here. I opened the bun on my burger. What I saw was fresh lettuce, tomato & a mediocre bun...but it was the burger took me back in time to when I was in 3rd grade in the cafeteria sitting next to my buddy Jimmy. It was about half a centimeter thin & could potentially have many uses as a coaster, a mini Frisbee, an eye patch, heat shield tiles on the next shuttle to Mars, skeet shooting - altho I recommend a 12 gauge to take this thing down. 

The misses noticed the dazed look on my face and says, ""Honey?""

""Yeah Jimmy, what's up?"" I reply..

She gave me that look & I snapped back into reality but was still in disbelief at this burger patty. I ate 2 bites & left it dismantled. I finished my fries & her charred chicken. The raw portion of her chicken ruined it for her. She ate her rice & salad, which were good.

The server was very nice & I told her what I thought of the food. I think this was the first place I've ever complained about the food at a restaurant, I just never go back. This meal was.....just very insulting. I am not an 8 year old kid anymore!

In hindsight I thought, maybe I was partially to blame ordering a burger at a Mediterranean joint but c'mon, it was the special that night!

The server seemed surprised when I showed her the brown disc. She informed me they ran out of fresh ground beef so I got a frozen one. Shame. I truly hope the next time this happens they just 86 their special & not serve garbage. I've had a better burger at a hospital at 3am.

I have been consigning at My Sister's Closet for many years (the past 10) and I have had many disappointments along the way as a consigner.  I have dropped off many high-end designer clothes to both the Scottsdale and Phoenix locations throughout the years.  Something that always bothered me was after consigning really expensive new or never worn pieces, I could not locate them anywhere in the store, yet the sales associate always told me they were still an open item on the floor.  The most recent bad experience I had was when I consigned a YSL 2-pc. jacket and slacks from Neiman Marcus.. 2 weeks after I consigned it at the Camelback location, I would periodically stop by to see if the itmes I consigned sold.  The YSL had not sold and showed still open on the floor, but I never found it anywhere.  I checked with sales associates who looked in lay-a-way, but said it wasn't there.  Before the 60 days for consignment was up, and on day 52, I decided to get my pieces back and pay the fee.  The items were nowhere to be found in the store and this is not the first time this has happened.  I looked at every single piece of clothing along with a sales associate.  When I asked to speak to the store manager or one of the owner's, I suddenly received a call back two days later where I was told my YSL outfit was found.  When I asked where?  I was told right there on the front designer rack.  I think not!  I'm not stupid and after taking my merchandise back, I wrote a letter to one of the owner's to at least give her the opportunity to respond.  It's been over 2 mos. and I have not heard one word.  Not one apology, not one explanation, nothing.  So I have decided to never consign with My Sister's Closet ever again, because they simply don't care, and as far as I'm concerned, they lack good cusomer service skills.

A couple of the rolls we ordered:

Viva Vegas Roll
Caterpillar Roll

The service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.

The rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.

The Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.

My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. 

My plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. 

The server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I.

I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.

I'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. 

Everything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. 

I also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.

I hate to write a negative review for a place that use to be an old neighborhood favorite.  But if your loyal customers just stop showing up & never criticize your performance you can 't FIX IT! 

So here's my father's words of wisdom that you won't get in any business school: 
""People go where they are invited, they stay where they feel welcomed!""

Hava java stopped inviting & welcoming customers when it started putting offensive signs on the bathroom door, and then password protecting its free WiFi service with passwords like BUY COFFEE! It seems that Hava Java lost the hunger to be a superior establishment by having better tasting products at a competitive price, and giving their customers a better experience than their competitors!

Hava Java  use to be a great place to hang out or for a cup of coffee in the Arcadia/Camelback area, but it seems in the past couple of years the place has consistently slipped and it is sharing the faith of another once upon a time great coffee hang out at the Biltmore area, The Coffee Plantation!",review,6,PZ9FB1czAYXuxLH7eegBvQ

i should have known when i walked in and received no greeting from the barista that this was going to be a stellar time. 

there was only one other customer standing at the counter, and two women waiting for their coffee to be made.  

as i approached the counter, i realized that what i originally thought was a customer was actually a friend of the barista's. the two of them were completely engrossed in some conversation about who knows what while the barista finished the coffee for the two waiting women. 

once she finished, i waited for her to acknowledge me and take my order.  instead, she continued right on with her conversation with her pal, never breaking to say hello or even make eye contact!  instead, the two of them kept on chatting while she started making herself a coffee! 

meanwhile, another customer walked in and stood behind me at the counter.  the two of us exchanged a few perplexed looks as the barista/pal nonsense continued on with no end in sight. after several minutes of this, he decided to give up and leave. the barista took no notice of this.  

at that point, i glanced at my phone and realized i had been standing there for a full ten minutes! ten minutes, debit card in hand, standing two feet from the barista with not even the slightest acknowledgement whatsoever. 

was it possible that i died in the car ride to hava java and no one could see me? 

that was enough for me. i backed away from the counter and got the hell out of there. 

 
hava java-you should be absolutely ashamed at how this employee is treating your customers. i do not plan to ever return, and i'm sure the other customer who walked out will be thinking twice about where he gets his coffee from now on.",review,5,rRiBDH2U_IlydXTh2a81Rg

The sign on the side of the building says ""OPEN EAT"" ...Straight forward & direct!  I liked that, so I tried it.

Inside & out, the place looks very old.  I would guess 1940s.  It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out.  There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign.  The second was the egg flower soup.  It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?).

The food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back.  The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah.  The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some ""hot tea"", which was lukewarm.  Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both.

The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.

First the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his ""technicians.""  Okay.

A couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.

He came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, ""either I come in an hour or on Monday.""  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.

Then he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.

When he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.

He then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.

The new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.

Bill was good in communication, told me upfront that if they  reach $400 on diagnosis cost, he stops and update me on results which he did.After $180 diagnosis on oil burning issue, no root cause was found. On the ABS he charged $160 and zeroed on ABS sensor.Took 3 to 4 hrs to tell this.

Bill made some other recommendation to fix radiator.A week later, i called them to fix radiator and ABS and i asked if they give credit of diagnosis towards repair. He said NO, and later asked me to come over to his shop to discuss.I eventually didn't go because his quote on radiator job was $680+ while most good shops are around  less than $550.

The awards that they had drove me to the shop, even though it was not on my route.In return i paid more than $400 just for diagnosis and got nothing back.What really disappointed me was the skill level of the mechanics there.

This is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.

I should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.

With a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved ""clean"" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.

If the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again.",review,2,v8prSSKtN8-avfAUO0ZYkQ

That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.

I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.

I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.

The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.

The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price.",review,8,5G-6WKQ7VHcLsvRt6kqKvQ

I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it.  All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me.

I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley.

In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed.  The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band.  There is no longer a $7 buffet.  There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles.  Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!?  I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!!

And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a ""rebranding.""

They did still have a good crowd.  I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me.  But they were not prepared.  The service was very poor.  (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!?  Cha Ching!!!?)

Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen.

We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach & bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of  a drama queen.  That's why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   I'd lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee & dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, (They have a Renoir) , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream & sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup.  Again, I'm not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold & he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   We'll never go back, especially to eat!

Some friends at work decided to make it a group outing.  There were 14 of us.  I paid $120 for four, so I could bring visiting family.  The original ""value"" of the meal is $240.  What a joke!  It says in the fine print that a gratuity of 15% would be charged at the restaurant on the original ""value"" of the meal.  Not true.  Gratuity of 20% was added to my bill at the end of the night.  This wouldn't be so bad if the server/bartender wasn't so HORRIFICALLY unfriendly, rude, and unprofessional.  Really, dude?!  You made over $200 for the 2 hours you spent serving us!  He would have made more if he had been nice.  It was made clear that we had bought discount vouchers, the gratuity was already included, and our service reflected that.  But guess what?  Those are 14 people that will NEVER patronize your business again.

Let's start from the beginning.  When you park, you are required to valet your car to the tune of $7.  Note to Geordie's.  Every other establishment in town that is doing well offers free valet.  

We arrived 40 minutes early to enjoy the views and a glass of wine on the patio.  I should have known when I went to order wine and was ignored for 10 minutes that the tone for the evening was set.  When I asked for a glass of sweet white for my dining companion and the bartender said ""we don't really have one"" I was officially turned off.  Naturally when we sat for dinner we were offered a wine list boasting hundreds (I think 650) bottles of wine.  Really?!  None of those bottles are white and sweet?  No riesling?  No gewurtstraminer?  

When we finally sat, the server ended up being that very same bartender, who made a huge deal about the check splitting and where we sat.  He actually cussed during the process.  So unbelievably unprofessional.  I have never felt like such an inconvenience at a restaurant.

We all ordered our meal from a pre fix menu of what appeared to be traditional Applebees fare.  When you title your poultry option at a fine dining establishment ""Corn Flake crusted chicken"" you have to know what you're in for.  The portions were decent but I had bland risotto and a confit of vegetables that turned out to be a cold, pasty, flavorless mess.  I tried the chicken bacause I typically order chicken.  It was cooked to chewy and also flavorless except for a mushroom ""sauce"" which I'm guessing came from a Campbell's soup can.

I ordered a bottle of Tempranillo to the tune of $77 which was decent.  Best part of the night, in my opinion.

At the end, the bill came.  $169.  I had already paid for the voucher, so naturally I thought it was a mistake.  No.  I was charged the $77 for the wine.  OK.  $62 gratuity.  That was hard to stomach.  That's 20% of the pre-discounted $240 meal and 20% of the $77 wine.  Sorry, the guy was a jerk and undeserving of 20%.  Especially since the fine print stated that a 15% gratuity would be charged.

The last $30 was tax.  $30 in tax!  Do the math, folks!  They charged me tax on the original $240 price of the meal.  Even though the sales price of the meal vouchers was $120!  I don't even think that's legal!  Charge sales tax on a prediscounted price?  Do you go into a store and buy a $100 sweater on sale for $50 and then pay tax on the original $100 price?  That was ridiculous.  Mind you, I had already bought 4 glasses of wine at the bar and tipped the (lousy) bartender for that.

Sorry for the lengthy review, but I'm gonna bottom line it for you.  I love  dining out.  In this economy, I understand that fine dining establishments have to nickel and dime you to survive.  But Geordie's is NOT fine dining!  It's actually quite awful!  All told, I spent over $300 for a really sub par meal and I was treated poorly to boot.

Get it together!  They either need to hire a real chef and provide a true fine  dining experience, or cater to a different clintele.  Although I can't think of anyone who would enjoy their food.  I would rather eat at TGI Fridays...",review,1,OltjhqyxmulDUtoimczoKw

My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.

We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.

We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.

I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.

We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.

Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.

The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.

The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.

For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.

I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.

All of this based on the fact that she was coughing.  He completely ignored my every word.  It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog.  Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now.  He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,.  After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better.  I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it.  In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it.  So it's odd he brings it up now.  He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure.    It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned.  But as I said, as a rescuer, I'm a pro at this by now, and know when I'm being given a grotesque sales pitch.   I give good reviews when they're warranted.  I have NO reason not to. BTW, I'd been to the office of the ""specialist"" he was going to refer me to (read my review on the Vet. Specialists in Gilbert).  NO THANKS.  And the other ""specialist""  was at another office I'd been to.  They wanted to put my dog UNDER (yes, anesthesia) to take a STICKER out of her leg.  What?

The vet came to see me after 45 minutes of waiting and was surprisingly uninformational, took the pups temperature took a look at him and said ""well it could be anything really"".
I honestly got more information from reading webmd than from going to see Dr. Halver. He prescribed my pup $66 antibiotics and $45 nasal drops on top of a $57 exam fee.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  

My experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  

And patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  

After my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'

Enough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients.",review,3,V1_3yModtZm-WmHs1zbc7g

Maybe it was because I was there for a company dinner with about 20 people (although the restaurant was empty). Maybe it was because I spent the last three weeks on a whirlwind tour of New York, Philadelphia, and Asheville, NC.

In any case, aside from the service, which was very good, I was deeply unimpressed with the food here. We started off with a plate of gnocchi in an Alfredo sauce and an appetizer of calamari. The gnocchi was completely drenched in Alfredo sauce, which is reminiscent of restaurants that try to hide the quality of their food with excessive sauce, e.g., The Olive Garden. The calamari was a bit rubbery, but otherwise average for a 2-3 star restaurant.

Onto the main course, I opted for the Ossobucco Milanese ($33). Again, this dish was completely covered in sauce. Aside from the bone, I wouldn't have been able to tell what I was eating. The risotto was overcooked, and there was a hint of a taste of dishwater so it was probably diluted to keep it from burning on the stove.

Again, the service was very good. And their bread was probably the best part of the meal. Maybe this place did serve good Italian food at one time, but the oversaucing of the food just killed it for me. For $33, I would like to taste the quality and flavor of the meat. If I wanted to eat gravy, I'd go to Grandy's. And don't get me started on the decor. Wow. Just wow. Think mirrors.

My suggestion would be to skip this place and head over to BLT Steak for their escargot appetizer ($7) during happy hour and then to Beckett's Table for the Pork Osso Bucco Confit ($18). And if you want a cleaner taste, try 5th & Wine. Either way, you'd be spending about $10-$15 less money for much better food and atmosphere.",review,2,2IbMDQWmzM-kY7bhjS87zw

I have a group of friends that eat their regularly so I've seen this place go up and down with quality. 

The big issue is there's no attention to detail when the orders go back to the kitchen. They actually seem to have a tendency to do the exact opposite of what's requested. Don't get me wrong, when it's good it's good, but I've seen more food sent back to the kitchen at this restaurant than anywhere else. It's got to the point at times that I've seen the waiting staff actually argue with the cook.

When I arrived tonight my hopes were high, as the manager was actually here for the first time in months. She was aware that our group had complaints and actually came to talk to us about issues the kitchen of been having. After what seemed to be a constructive talk we placed our orders with the waitress with confidence. Well, needless to say my food was incorrect again. Not only was it wrong, it almost seemed intentionally incorrect. When I express my dismay the manager went and brought the cook out which made me very uncomfortable. 

At this point I was ready to cancel the order altogether, but they said they take the food back to correct it. What the manager brought to the table the second time was worse than the first. I wish I could say I couldn't believe it, but I've gotten quite used to this level of incompetence from this restaurant. I sent it back and told them to cancel the order altogether.

The only bright spot about this restaurant is the waiters and waitresses do seem to work hard, it's just the kitchen throws them under the bus with their incompetence and the management under staffs them so they always have too many tables.

I guess the only thing left for me to do is try and convince the 15 top that comes to eat there on a weekly basis that we need to start going to another restaurant, but my friends are a little stuck in their ways.

I just ate there about 20 minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off. My husband and I were in the mood for a good breakfast this morning, so we got to thinking...Matt's? Matt's is always awesome, but we didn't feel like waiting out in the rain for over an hour. The Original Pancake House? It's a close second so we opted for that and headed out. Once we got there, we realized 350 other people had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour. Not feeling like waiting, we hopped back in the car and jumped on our phones to check out what Yelp thought would be good nearby. Linda's was one of the places that popped up along our drive and we had both passed it a few times, always talking about wanting to try it. We looked at the reviews and there were lots of good ones raving about the food (Really? Guy who said it was Matt's with pie? Really? I don't know where the hell you get off, but I'm holding you partially responsible for totally jacking up my Sunday breakfast). We got inside and the place is a real shithole. I don't mind, because I typically love eating at shady looking places and drinking in dive bars. It's like a real ""slice of life"" type of thing and I find the experience usually excels where the decor is lacking. Everything was blue and mauve...I haven't seen this much mauve since the late 80's. And again, that would usually be fine, except in this case, it doesn't look like anyone has cleaned the place since then either. Everywhere I looked, things were grimy and just not...clean. We sat at the counter (first mistake) and both ordered the JJ's Special (second mistake). Sitting at the counter was like having a backstage pass to a Michael Bolton show...or some other really shitty person you would never want to see backstage. We could see the entire operation and hear the cook bitching the whole time. That's right, I said cook. Singular. One person working in the kitchen. She came out a few times to yell at our server, called Linda (I sincerely hope it was not the owner Linda). She looked like the grandma from Napolean Dynamite. For those of you that get the reference, enough said. We could hear the dinging of microwave ovens and the grumbling of Napolean Dynamite's grandma in the weeds with tickets that she couldn't read due to Linda's supposedly shitty handwriting. We waited over a half hour for our food. Granted, we didn't have to wait to sit but seriously, a half hour for eggs, bacon and pancakes. When the food came out I was already over it. I took one look at the plate and knew this was not going to be good. My ""over-easy"" egg had totally runny whites and looked more like a sunny-side-up gone wrong. My bacon looked like it came from Fry's and the pancakes were the only edible thing on my plate. I don't know if they were edible because everything else was so totally shitty or if it was because I am 9 months pregnant and would have eaten shit cakes at that point. Nevertheless, the ambiance combined with the service and the food made for the absolute worst $28 I've ever spent on breakfast. $28 dollars!! For me and my husband to have pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. That did NOT include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible. It makes my blood boil just thinking of it and as I sit here writing, I am still starving. We should have just gone to the brass rail.

A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.

Also I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet.

I am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.

So I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.

The first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...

3 Cheese Plate
Chef's Pate
Calamari
Crispy Duck Breast
Creme Brulee

The food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.

The fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... 

By shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.

After going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O

So by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.

We drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. 

Once inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.

Sometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.

However - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked ""oh, that place!"". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.

This all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.

Please, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.

For the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.",review,8,ccL0exzbHqzO4lpp9AP8MA

Nothing really affected me but Reed suggested that he remove 3 wisdom teeth and 2 extra teeth below my gum line on my right lower side of my jaw.  So a total of 5 teeth.

Little did I know he was going to CUT AWAY my gum line and expose the roots of my existing teeth that were FINE. 

He claimed it would be fine and the gums would grow back, they never did. The exposed sections of the roots caused infection in my gums and I lost a molar and am probably going to lose another one this year.  

I haven't been able to chew solid food on the right side of my mouth for the past 9 years.  ridiculous.

I had to go here to have the rest of my wisdom tooth extractions because they were heavily impacted and needed surgery, which my regular (and awesome) dentist, Dr. Steen, could not perform.

First, imagine what you'd like a surgical center's office staff to be like. Sure, clinical, because they do the same thing every day. But how about professional? Professional would be nice. It was awful from the get-go. The front office lady looked very un-washed and her makeup looked a few days old. No ""Hello"" ""How are you"" or ""How may I assist you"", she just looked at us when we walked in and waited for us to say something. Then, ""Sign in"".

And you'll barely have any residual pain."" Look where I am now, Dr. Day! At the same pain levels as when I was with Dr. Steen. Ass. 

Dr. Day's little nurse techs strapped me down in the chair and started talking about another tech rather disparagingly, as if I wasn't there. Helloooo, I'm about 6 inches from your face and am not yet sedated. Could you hold off on the shop talk until I'm off in dreamy dream land? Kthx.

Second Attempt: 

The technician showed up the following week on time but immediately said that the charge for cleaning would be double what the owner quoted us the previous week. The technician said we were quoted basic cleaning prices and not the deep cleaning (grout + tile) that we needed. My wife and I were out of town and the technician proceeded with only the basic tile cleaning. 

Upon our return we found that the floors still were very dirty and even the basic cleaning that was done was sub-par.

We explained we have a coupon from their website. The quote was for 4 rooms, a hallway and a stair case and was between $125-150 (each room was $15 and the coupon, which I have saved off of their website says that pre-treatment is included). John also reassured us that the price would be the same as in years past (we've used them for 3 consecutive tenants), except that there is a $10 trip charge they've recently started charging. 

On the day of the cleaning (the following day), the technician who visited the townhouse called me and told me the price would be $195. I explained to him that we had a quote of $125 to $150 and that in years past the cost was $115 (so we expect the cost will be $125). The technician told me that the price of $125 is accurate, but there is $70 of pre-treatment, which was a deal (he told me it would normally be 700 ft at $.20). I explained that the coupon says pre-treatment is included and when he said it wasn't, I told him that I am sorry but that is not what I was quoted and he should go home. The technician then asked me ""well what are you willing to pay""? He was clearly upset and told me at least twice that he just drove 40 miles. I explained that it isn't my fault that they service an area so far from the trucks or that his boss drastically misquoted the price. He then asked me if I'd pay $180, ""no"", how about $170, ""no"", how about $160, ""no"", how about $150, ""fine"". At that point I wanted to stop arguing with him as all of this was occurring with my brand new tenant (2nd day in unit) present as he took the day off of work to be home with the technician. I figured I'd call John after, explain to him that we had paid $115 each of the previous 2 years, and that we could just adjust this to $125. 

When I called John, I got basic belligerence. He first told me that he asked my wife how dirty the carpet is. Not sure what that means, but that was never asked. Plus the quote was $125-150 with an assurance that it would be the same price as last year plus $10. When I attempted to reason with John, he called me a liar (re: what the coupon on his website says), my wife a liar (re: her statement that he never asked how dirty the carpet was) and never responded to why the cost wasn't the exact same as previous years, plus $10 like was quoted. John wouldn't let me speak and just spoke over me, stating he never should have quoted me (with which I agreed). The carpet was in the exact same shape (several stains) as it was after previous tenants. Zee Best couldn't remove the stains in years past and I didn't expect them to this time (which they didn't). I just wanted a clean carpet (i.e. no dirt) for my new tenant. The conversation ended with John finishing yelling at me and promptly hanging up.

So, I called on a Tuesday to see if I could get some pants hemmed for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The dinner was out of town, and my flight left Wednesday night, so I knew I was asking for a really quick turnaround and I apologized for that at the start of the conversation. 

Me - ""I kinda need these pants ready by tomorrow, is that even possible?""
Mean PCT lady - ""Well, It's possible, I guess""
Me - ""Ok cool, well I'm not trying to be a jerk, but since I'm leaving tomorrow night, I need a yes or no answer... if it's no, that's totally understandable""

Me - ""Well, not really, possible implies that there is a chance...""
PCT satan - (cuts me off) ""Ok well thank you, but I can only tell you it's possible, so maybe you should try somewhere else."" (hangs up on me).

I call Brother's Tailors and Clothing, they were sooo awesome and friendly and they hemmed my pants that day! I was still kinda mad about how rude the PCT lady was, so I called back to ask for her manager. After a long conversation of me trying to explain how rude she was (she didn't get it) she ended the call with the statement that pretty much sums there lousy business: ""Well, we've been in business for over 50 years and if you don't like the way we do business you can go somewhere else.""

My sister was getting married and she worked a deal with the owner for reduced alteration price for all the girls in the wedding party.  First of all, I was charged more than the agreed-to price.  I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just let it pass.  When I went to pick it up two weeks later, it was way too tight in the bust area.  At first, the tailor (I think her name was Stormy) refused to take the blame for the mistake.   Her response:  ""Something must have changed since you were here last.""  Was she implying that I had somehow gained a bust size in two weeks?!?  When I came back a couple weeks later (I don't live in Phoenix but was travelling there often for wedding preparations), the dress was still too tight.  The zipper zipped all the way up, but it was still so tight that I couldn't even take a full breath.  Yet the same woman was there trying to convince me that it was fine.  I think she just wanted to get me the hell out of her shop.  I insisted she redo it again and when I went back a week later (2 days before the wedding), it finally fit, but there was still more trouble.  For one thing, Stormy nearlly gave me the wrong dress.  Second, and more seriously, she freaking lost one of the straps belonging to my dress!!!  When I asked her about it, her reply was ""I guess I can look for it.""  She still hadn't found it a couple minutes later and probably would have left it at that if I hadn't pushed the issue.  Her solution was to tell me to take one of the straps off one of the other bridesmaids dresses.  Can you believe that?!?  The nerve of that woman.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY UNPROFESSIONAL!  She grudgingly agreed to make me a replacement strap. 

I should mention that during this entire ordeal I never once received an appology.  Stormy kept putting the blame on everything but her less-than-adequate sewing skills.  If I hadn't already paid the full amount, I would have refused to do so.

I know I'm not an isolated incident because another girl in the party had the same problems only worse.  I had to come back 3 times but she came back 5 times.  She also didn't receive any kind of appology for the trouble.

Checked the website and the detail special was gone,  No big deal, it was a gift card, so we thought we would take her car down and get what we could for the $85.

She drives up and the pitch begins.  What can I get for $85?  Salesman goes through the list and says for a bit more, you can get scratches buffed out. super-detailing, yada, yada, yada, inside of tires cleaned even!  (Ok, that last part was exaggeration).  Salesman says ""that'll be $200"".  Um, no, wife says, I have $85.  I want what I can get for $85.  Salesman says okay, and walks away.  Five minutes later, Salesman comes back, taps on window (she's been waiting all this time), and says, ""Okay, we can add interior/exterior detailing and shampooing the carpets and cleaning the seats for $100 more.""  No, she says again, I only have $85, that's what I want to spend.  Okay, he says, we'll drop the inside-tire cleaning, and the scratch-buffing and just add the inside seat-cleaning.  worn down and impatient, she agrees to it.  That'll be $120.  Whatever, she says, just let me get out of this hell.

Meanwhile, I'm waiting outside to take her to our next appointment, which we barely made, after all this heckling.  Two and a half hours later, the car comes back, it looks very nice from a distance, all shiny and trim and  tires blackened. But when you look closer, there are still bug smears on the front of the hood, which I was able to clean off with some simple green, and the seats weren't that clean - at least not to warrant that much extra.  Overall, it was a fair job.  Would I pay $120 for it again?  No, I don't think so.  And after the sales pitch my wife endured, we will not be returning.

Suggestion for Lindstrom.  It's okay to sell your services and to upsell.  Badgering and pressuring customers however, is not okay.  It's better to work with your customers, and within their budget.

Honestly.

It was my one year anniversary.
Me and me man went here to celebrate

I had a lobster tail
And a filet

On the way home, I got violently ill
Like, within ten minutes of leaving this place.
And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)

I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc

After about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore
I called 911

The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.

It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.

After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.

I'll never eat here again.
Simply because I've never been so sick.

It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.

I contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.

My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.

I'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.

My friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow ""shots"", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?

While we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.      

Hillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.

The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return. 

We arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by ""Al."" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked ""Al"" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, ""We'll get you seated, no problem."" After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed ""Al"" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked ""Al"" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours? 

Fortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender ""Christian"" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by ""Christian."" We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame.",review,0,i6fhhuBpSP_ZJwGL95vNPQ

I know they are owned by the same company but have different menu items. When we walk in I ask if there are any choices for kids and the hostess says yes a kids burger and a grilled cheese. Waitress comes over, not genuinely friendly, more like fake friendly. I ask about the kids burger since that's pretty much the only suitable option. She tells me that there's no difference btwn kids and regular burgers. Both $16. Ok I'll pass and order her a California roll. It was 5pc and very different tasting and still had imitation crab but still cost $13. I've never seen a Cali roll cast more than $8. And that's regular price, not $4 happy hour. 
I order the French dip which apparently is prime rib but mine was more fat then meat. Disgusting...had to return it. The only good part of the lunch was our appetizer, spinach dip. It's always a win. The mgr was mediocre and took off the Cali roll but acted like he just graduated with a hotel restaurant management degree and was not sure how to treat a customer.

I remember very little about the meal because the service was HORRIBLE.  Red wine came after salads had been served.  A white wine sat on our table unopened until we were able to flag someone down--the serving of the meal was uneven at best and then servers got switched mid meal.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple ""I'm sorry for the wait"" would have gone a long way.

There were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. 

We sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening

While waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. 

Finally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). 

My wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, ""For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal."" I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. 

While waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. 

Anyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, ""Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints.""

Well this was a bad idea... especially on an anniversary dinner celebration. Please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true. We have eaten the food through their catering and it is delicious, so this makes me think all the energy is expelled here alone? Like the other reviews had said this is a creepy outdated awkward place that doesn't have any background music playing at all. So yes the tables are very close together with no music so imagine how uncomfortable that will be. We immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood. My dirty martini was garnished with tiny olives on a sandwich pick for an upscale price. The server also spilled most of my wife's martini during her trip to the table saying how it was ""overfilled."" We received a basket of bread that was burnt and unappealing which ended our idea of a maybe hopeful outcome. We were both confused because the dinner menu was nothing like we had eaten through catering. The server informed us that we had probably meant to dine at the ""bistro,"" and was happy to transfer us over next door. Feeling questionable that it would be any better we paid our tab and agreed to go take a table they were holding for us. 

We then walked over to the bistro side of the restaurant only to be disappointed once again.  Packed in like a meat house and sat there for 15 minutes without being asked if we'd like a drink we decided to walk out. They have again an awkward system of seat yourself and apparently serve yourself as well? We were so confused by all the groups of people lining outside to get in this place. We were more than willing to give up our table to the next unfortunate guest. 

The parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed. It is only valet and gets backed up by the cars coming in and the one attendant trying to run the place. Some lady thought I was a valet driver and proceeded to yell at me because I was standing around not helping her.

I should have read the Yelp reviews before we  decided to try the ""famous French Restaurant"", We had reservations at 8:00 and arrived a little late(8:10) . We were greeted and told to wait . Finally the hostess returned and took us to the dining room that had only a few tables in use. After sitting without menus, water bread or attention for some time we finally received service. The menu looked good with some French favorites and with some southwest flavor as anticipated. We ordered wine( good list) and later ordered foie gras and rack of lamb. We got our wine and a bread basket with ""famous croissants"". OUR FIRST MAJOR disappointment. The brown bread was warm but old and tough. The croissants were tiny, old, tough. (Pillsbury could have done better).
 The foie gras arrived with a nice presentation. When we had ordered we had asked if toast points would accompany the foie gras and the waitress said no that we had the bread basket. We asked if some sort of toasted bread could be brought(e.g. baguette). she said she would see if something was available.   The foie gras had four pieces of the brown bread that were burned. The foie gras was a normal piece of sauteed liver on a slice of pineapple. There was nothing about the dish that made you lick your lips(as we usually do with foie gras). The sauce was bland, the pineapple was not grilled, and for some reason they added a few sliced cherry tomatoes on the plate.
The rack of lamb arrived again with a nice presentation:  scalloped potatoes, green beans and peas, and cauliflower florets. Small quantities but reasonable. The lamb ribs had been sliced with au juice. The rack was miniature with small thin medallions, appropriately medium rare, but not a good quality lamb.The best item on the dish was the red pepper jelly on endive. 
We did not take a chance on dessert,  paid our bill and departed. We knew now why there so few customers on a Friday night.

To be responsible I only ordered one glass of wine ($15). The server with the Brit accent was rude and condescending from that point on. His response was a miffed ""just one glass "" repeated back snarkily. I ordered 2 apps, a split salad, and two entrees and dessert.  He was pained to inquire if it was good and we had to fight to get our water glasses filled. He attempted to hurry us out, all the while kissing the asses of the regulars at the adjacent table. He didnt let us even get halfway through the dessert before unceremoniously dumping our check. I then had the gall to pay with a Capital One credit card. The asinine snob opened the check folder in front of us, looked down and made a sour looking face. 

It was clear that 1. he was pissed that there was no bottle of wine ordered to bump his tip. 2. His perception of Capital One cards was that only low class and credit crunched losers own them. I recently got divorced and my Ex destroyed our credit, Sorry Mr Bean but thats what i paid with. I left a 20% tip because it is my custom from owning restaurants.

So if the owners or management of Vincents read this please understand that I had on a custom hand made shirt, new Gucci Loafers, and a $12,000 Franck Muller watch. I chose your restaurant, i CHOSE not to drink, I chose to pay with a non-status credit card, and I will most certainly CHOOSE not to return based on the entirely unacceptable and highly offensive behavior of  my server based on the his uneducated and insulting perceptions. I left a $30 tip because I choose to so the bus boys and other staff would be tipped out. This idiot waiter that was ONLY concerned with his tip needs to learn that his customers are often much more intelligent then he is, and that gratuities are earned for service. Good service, not rude, condescending, childish, idiocy based on his perception of who his clients are. He clearly misconstrued who and what I was, and did the ""look down at the tip and thank you graciously at the door"" after he saw his grubby $30 left on my low class credit card. 

As a side note, I might have ordered a full bottle of wine had I been impressed with your wine list. It just happens that I am a dealer and collector in ultra-rare California Cult Cabs and prefer to drink exceptional bottles when I do drink more then one glass. In fact snotty ass server, I doubt that you have the connections or financial resources to obtain one bottle, more or less the 1000 that I have in my home. Im sure your $750,00 home, that you were so proudly gloating about to the next table, is much nicer then mine too, I mean I only drank one glass and paid for it on a cheesy card!

Run the other direction unless you want a true French experience- treated rude rude rude for no reason other then greed, insecurity and jaded crass immaturity. There are plenty of places to eat where the server would be grateful for a $30 gratuity. Its not Europe, gratuities are discretionary. This ass of a server just has an unearned sense of entitlement.

I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said ""The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.""  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was ""Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.""  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said ""Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?"" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said ""OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.""  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  
I do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget.",review,3,P7wpyeAh2yGzvmhocLsuPg

I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.

This is the wonderful help i've gotten.
Dr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.

The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. 

I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they ""tried"" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?

Then there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.

And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. 

And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. 

The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. 

I could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!",review,4,Uk5DAoM8NJVEfeSVYPpIRg

For the second time, I have been turned away from my absolute fave cardio class because it has filled up to capacity 45 minutes before it starts. What? Really? Does this mean I have to speed up my after-work rush just to ensure I can write my name down on their sign-in sheet? That's bogus. 

What a fiasco. The last time the class filled up, I went up to see for myself. So many regulars, who said they signed up, were without spots. That's when one went down to get the sign-in sheet and an employee. Good for her. 

Total chaos. When I asked the front desk what I needed to reserve my spot, chick-a-boo behind the counter had no clue. Then the guy who pulled out a binder really wasn't any better. I wanted to know the process. Don't just tell me to sign-up and pay a $1. I want to know how the system works, man! I said, ""Good to know for future reference,"" then I left. It's also good to know that you MUST reserve a spot IN PERSON so they can take your dollar. I don't trust them. They'd probably lose my information and I'd get screwed over, again. 

I don't use the machines there because they're shitty. I go for the one or two cardio classes that I absolutely love - because of the instructors. Everything else creeps me out, even the female locker room. 

Plus, the one time I asked the front counter staff about a personal trainer, she had NO IDEA their names. I tried to describe the one I saw upstairs working out with a client. He was doing moves I used to do, ones that really focus on stability and strength. I thought, ""He looks like he knows his stuff, and I have free sessions here I still haven't used. Oh, why not?"" Well, chick-a-boo had no clue. ""Go look over there at the board. They have their photos up."" That didn't help me, because I didn't really see the trainer on the board. Maybe he was new or he cut his hair. I don't know... How f'n annoying. It reminds me of when I first joined and asked for a trainer to give me a call. Nobody did. Suckas.

I returned to find a different employe who informed me that the policy was actually refunding my card at days end. 
I explained that I was told differently, he offered neither apology nor explanation, just told me to check back tomorrow. 
No refund the next day. No refund the day after. In the meantime, I had a returned check at my bank due to funds not being there (thanks HD) and incurred a $35 fee. So I returned, was given the run around and demanded a manager. This guy was worse than his employees! Told me ""if you can't afford the deposit, maybe you should rent elsewhere!"" He then promised to refund my card that day and I left. Well well well, imagine my surprise when checking my account the next morning, I discovered not a credit, but another $75 charge! And with this, another $35 back fee! 
Needless to say, I angrily returned to speak with the HD manager, and he rudely informed me it was out of his hands and I had to call corporate headquarters. Thanks to the fraud department at my bank, I finally got my money back, but it took 4 weeks, and $70 in bank fees.

I used to be in there a lot.  All of the workers bust their guts trying to get the orders out and correct.  They are exceptionally helpful and try their best.  Apparently, the management (or corporate) doesn't care, or doesn't want to retrain and hire more workers to cover the paint department, or doesn't want to pay, or doesn't care if they have workers comp claims or whatever.  That is a tough department with high volume.  If you go for paint, try for Friday nights or some other off time, due to the backlog.

The waiting room was not very clean and the furniture was worn and outdated.  While I was waiting, people were being rushed out the door who had just had their Lasik procedure done.  The staff were walking them out telling them their aftercare plan in front of the whole waiting room.  When the ""sales girl"" finally called me back into a room she did not apologize for the wait.  She only said, ""this is surgery day.  We are busy.  We tried calling to reschedule you (I received no such call). Then she made me look into a machine while she looked at my eyes for about ten seconds.  She then led me to her sales office to talk pricing. She gave a very lengthy sales pitch and did a poor job pretending to listen to my concerns. I am nervous about having this procedure done and she made me more nervous.  She made it seemed like I needed to have the procedure done ASAP before my eyes got worse.  Then she made a morbid comparison to Lasik being equivalent to cutting her finger off.  Then she pushed a finger down and modeled to me what her hand would like missing a finger.  She would not offer specifics on pricing and kept throwing out numbers and percentages.  She made me feel rushed and like I had to decide today if I was going to go with them for the procedure. She discouraged me from using another form of payment other than their financing and kept throwing percentage rates around as to why she was right.  I asked for documentation stating the pricing and discounts available to me and she declined to produce any such document stating, ""This is not like buying a car.  I am not giving you any written pricing.  Anyway, the pricing changes all the time.  These are your eyes we are talking about and you only have two (like I didn't know that).""  She created a huge sense of urgency with getting the procedure done and kept repeating, ""You only have two eyes.""  She kept telling me what ""most people"" do, which is pay the day of the consultation and get the procedure done the following week.  She also told me she needed a $100 deposit before I left today if I decided to go with them.  I told her that her sales pitch was making me feel uncomfortable and rushed as I am in the early stages of exploring this procedure.  She became offended, defensive, and moody claiming it was not a sales pitch and that ""I only have two eyes."" She would not even continue the consultation and have my eyes tested to see if I was even a ""candidate"" for Lasik without my committing to pay.  I then said that I felt their company was not a good fit for me and she led me out.  I do not recommend this company based on my consultation experience.  I would not trust them with the actual procedure because they seem very concerned with getting people in and out of there as fast as they can to make $$$! If you do get the procedure done at this place, you should not pay more than around $1500 per eye because that's the final price I was verbally quoted at my consultation.  But, like the ""sales lady"" said...prices are always changing! This company needs to train their sales people on how to effectively communicate with clients, build trust, and be empathetic!!

I said I had numerous questions, but would prefer to speak to the surgeon (No need asking them twice, since I really only cared about what the surgeon had to say).  She said asking her my questions/concerns was ""one in the same"".  I think not.  That was the first red flag.  The second one came after she said I would not be meeting the surgeon at all prior to the day of surgery.  Who in their right mind agrees to an elective surgery without meeting the surgeon prior to the day of surgery?  I have never heard of such a thing!

On my last visit there ever, I  watched every second of the near Halloween horror:  my carry out order was brought to another table, to an elderly couple who were obviously dining in.  When the front counter guy asked if they were carrying out, they said they didn't care.  

I watched them open the carry out boxes.  I watched them take the boxes to the salsa counter.  I watched them take a bite from the boxes.  I watched them shut the boxes when the counter guy realized that he brought them the wrong order when their order was finally ready and called out at the front counter.  

I WATCHED IN HORROR AS HE RAN OVER TO THEIR TABLE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY RECEIVED THE WRONG ORDER, AND HE CLOSED  THEIR BOXES AND BROUGHT THEM TO MY TABLE AND HANDED THEM TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was.....horrified.  I was in shock.  I said:  um, I'm not taking that if they put stuff on it, and I know they put stuff on it and took a bite.  
 
The counter guy opened up the box and said, I don't see any stuff on it.  it is fine.
He closed the box and handed it back to me.  
 
Another customer walked passed me and I glanced at him in horror, hoping to get some kind of compassion and sympathy.  He stared back at me with no emotion.
 
I turned to the counter guy and said, I really don't want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it.  He says, I don't see that they put anything on it.  It's fine.  And he laughed.  It doesn't matter to me if he laughed at me or thought it was funny, but it was NOT funny.
 
I walk out of the store DAZED and IN SHOCK with the two boxes.  
 
Never in my life, even in the dirtiest grossest restaurant have I blatantly experienced anything like this.
 
When I got home, I opend the box to microwave the hell out of the plates thinking I would give it to my dogs;  and there was a foot long hair EMBEDDED across both tacos which I slowly pulled out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! 
 
I can not even make this S*IT UP!!!!!!!
 
I will never, ever go back there ever again.  Good luck suckers.  I hope you take your Cipro. You get what you pay for.   Never ever again.

I suppose it would be an ""okay"" place if you want to hang out in a neighborhood bar and play pool and/or video games and drink at a mediocre price.  I read on their white board that they have a live blues band a couple of nights a week (Fri/Sat maybe?), which, if they're decent, could be pretty cool.

Anyway, let me walk you through my experience...

It's Tuesday night and my friends want to go to a karaoke place.  Why they chose this place I will never know.  I was actually a little scared when we walked up.  Some of the patrons were outside smoking and they looked a little rough around the edges.  Now, I'm really not one to judge based solely on appearance, but...  I digress.

The bar itself is laid back.  Wood paneling, some high tables, low tables, long bar with stools.  Plenty of room for big groups.  I would say there were a couple dozen people there which is pretty good for a Tuesday night.  I didn't visit the bathroom because I was scared to see what it looked like.

The bartender was just ok.  I got my first drink (draft beer) pretty quickly.  However, when I went up to the bar for a second beer, the bartender was nowhere to be found.  I stood there for about 10 minutes.  She finally came back in after her smoke break and poured me a beer.  I still tipped her because that's how I roll.

The karaoke was AWFUL.  The song selection was large, but I couldn't seem to find any of my regular songs, which are popular hip-hop songs from the current decade.  If you're into singing Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Pantera and other songs from way back in the day, this place is definitely for you.  You will be entertained by middle-aged obese men moshing next to their table and growling into the microphone, while the host either sings uninvited backup or makes out with her boyfriend.  But that's not even the best part.

My friends and I wanted to sing a specific song and the host overheard us.  She said cool.  We tipped her (heavily) so she would move us up in the rotation.  We waited about 20 minutes.  Then, she came over and said she didn't have that song.  Surprise.  We asked her to move our other songs up in the rotation and she said no problem, but she did ask me to change my selection (?) for some reason.  I didn't and I really wish I could have gotten my money back.

It's the most ridiculous karaoke experience I have ever had in my life and I won't be repeating it... ever.  I guess that's what I get for going to a local Irish pub to do karaoke!",review,2,hY83SqqHJlsZQaP9Dv42Tw

I used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then ""went to the back"" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. 

The person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. 

We asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. 

So an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online.

I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access?

I find that I am still very hurt by the way we were treated by Dr. Zacher's office.  My husband had gone in for his regularly scheduled cleaning.  The office wanted to take x-rays.  My husband was not having any dental issues or problems.  He was in for a regular cleaning.  He is in the medical profession and has done a lot of research about the overuse of dental x-rays.  He asked that he not have x-rays taken on this visit.   Dr. Zacher and his staff said that they could not clean his teeth without the x-rays so they couldn't help him any further and he left the office without the cleaning.  We never heard anything further on this matter.  A couple of months after this incident our daughter fell and injured her tooth.  When we were checking out, Rhonda said that since my husband had walked out on his visit that we would have to pay for his visit that day.  The total was well over $300.  I was standing at the desk, while Rhonda was saying rather loudly that since my husband walked out we had to pay.  It was very embarrassing since there was a family friend in line behind me.  I was so humiliated.  I didn't know what to say so I paid the bill.  I later inquired of several friends in the medical field about the industry standard for no show fees.  The typical fee for a no show visit is about $30.  They had never sent us a bill for the visit, but rather waited until I was in the office to embarrass me on the spot.  We are a family with seven children, one in college, and they saw no problem with being unfair and gouging us for the visit.  I have no problem with paying a REASONABLE fee for the visit.  My husband was not asked to pay a cancellation fee when he left, and we were never sent a bill in the mail.

Stuffy, Pretentious, uncomfortable, & Mediocre Summarizes This Venue! 

The Resort entry & valet parking is very impressive! (1st class) 
You will walk thru a beautiful Spanish Hacienda Court Yard to enter this old world decadent restaurant! (Still 1st class) 

""So what's the problem"" you ask? 

Well when you enter this restaurant with a reservation, a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs. to get your table!(OK it's a popular high end place, & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess....) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine! 

You finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine! (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share!) 
So you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate, or get treated as such. 

Now the food does taste good, but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker, it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish! But how much am I paying for this dish! 
It's only half a cut of the fish! 
Despite all the mastication, it is very hard to swallow! 
Somehow you finish your dish! (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer!) 

So you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters ""Fave Pick"" on desert! Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots! 
So your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table, & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the ""you cheapskate evil eye"" walking out of this restaurant! 

Oh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet, $5 tip also will get you a ""are you kidin' me look as well!""",review,2,PZ9FB1czAYXuxLH7eegBvQ

I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.

 A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes.

This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding. If you want a list of who actually used the valet, forget it. Expect to meet every deadline they give you with your payments, but do not expect such promptness from them. And if you use their ""preferred vendors,"" remember who some of those vendors really work for at the end of the day...

I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the ""bar supervisor"". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the ""bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, ""Thank you"" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.
Rude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.   We did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were told-we felt too unwelcomed.",review,0,kxIs2EkZR8ipVIgg6xyQGw

My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later. 
Imagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,""we need a credit card for this reservation"".  ""I thought I paid ahead, but ok....""  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please. 
The valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.

The stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would ""disappear in a week or so"". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, ""I don't care about that, what I care about is..."" I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place? Spend your hard earned money some place else.",review,0,vnvTpEzJ8ycSlZy_taxVug

So I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!

So take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.

Now, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.

If there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.

Anyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.

All of the sandwiches are placed in sacks with plastic utensils and styrofoam cups, even if you eat in. This is not eco friendly, my pasta with marinara (which I can make at home) came in a nice plastic to-go container.

I called in advance for an appointment. I went in and was led to the Relaxation Room by the very friendly Spa receptionist. I had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment, hoping she could take me sooner and I could be on my way sooner. There was not one other person in the Relaxation Room with me. There also isn't a wall clock and I soon found out why. 

My extra ten minutes pass. No waxer approaches me. Another ten minutes go by and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on. I decide to go up front and see what the deal is. The receptionist says she will find out and I tell her I have places to go and can't wait much longer. I go back to the relaxation room...which is now not at all relaxing. Five more minutes pass....the receptionist comes to say she's sorry and the waxer will be right with me. It was at least another five, maybe even ten, and I was boiling mad. The waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping 2 minutes.  Sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment. The receptionist didn't think it was worth comping me the $13.50 cost so the waxer received no tip. 

The second time I used the Spa was when I injured my back in one of the classes and had to run, crying, out of the class. There is no Sports Medicine person on staff as far as I was aware so I hobbled to the Spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon. I begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didn't start until 9AM. This, by the way was at about 8:10AM. I'm standing in front of this woman, having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and she's telling me to wait an hour? Finally she figured out I was NOT kidding and said she'd call around to see who could come in ASAP. She helped me into a chair in the very UN-relaxing room and I wept alone there for about 15 minutes. She happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in 15-20 minutes. I had no cell phone, watch or wall clock to measure that time, nor was any other help offered so I just continued weeping. It was 8:30AM (I'm guessing) when another spa-goer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change. I managed to get in there as well (after a bit) and ask her if she knew the time. 8:45AM. 

Obviously my massage therapist didn't show up until 9AM. That would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury. Sure the massage was decent (not in price mind you). I just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and I absolutely will not return there. By the way, the showers in the spa area are TERRIBLE.

they threw my things out 4 weeks ago, i went in to find these facts out over 3 weeks ago, i waited patiently to hear from them, never did, so I called today and the guy who threw my things away said he was waiting to talk to the GM.

I rescued a nine-year old, 7lb dog from the Humane Society. Minnie was diagnosed with a Stage 3 heart murmur and the vet said she did not require medication. 30 days later, Dr. Cruz examined her and told me that her heart murmur was at 5.5-6 and required an Ace Inhibitor--$24 from his office. I called my local pharmacy and learned that I could buy it there for $4. I requested that he give me automatic renewals on the script--it is only 2.5 mg--because I have recently lost my job and health insurance and do not have the extra money for unneeded pet exams. When I got to the pharmacy, the script did not include renewals. I called the office and Stacey, the receptionist, said ""don't worry about it, we will renew it at the end of the month."" So, when I called back to get the renewal, Stacey told me that Dr. Cruz wanted Minnie to have lab work for $98 (he originally told me $198) before he renewed the script. I asked for what? She said, she didn't know. I re-explained that I am still unemployed and that when I find a job, I will bring her back in for an exam. Dr. Cruz got on the phone and immediately told me that he would not renew this script. As a health care professional for nearly 20 years, I asked him, ""why do you need this blood work when this script is prevention....it will not cure a heart murmur?"" He became angry and said that he did not want any liability. He further told me that my ""unemployment status was not his problem."" He said ""I won't renew her meds unless you get the blood work. Sorry, I can't help you..."".Then, he yelled, ""get a job!!!!!"" Then, he hung up! I called back and he answered and continued to scream at me.  I asked again, what is the blood work for? He again refused to answer me and hung up once more. I am reporting his behavior to the Arizona Medical Examining Board.

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate.

This place sucked.  All-around.  The only positive note I have is they had the most recent US Weekly.  Let me start from the beginning...

I went here b/c I was driving home from work and decided that it had been at least 5 days since my last pedicure, my co-workers were extra bitchy today and I deserved 25 minutes of pampering.  So I stopped when I saw the first nail salon.  This strategy works 9/10, so don't fault me for that, trust me, it works.

I walk in and they get me in right away.  I pick my color and sit down.  No massaging chair, no magazines (I had to ask for one) and nowhere to put my purse.  Whatever.  So, the girl comes along and does my pedicure...it's fine, not great, but not awful.  I was rather annoyed that she didn't even dry off my legs and just slapped on some cream.  Cream + watery legs = awkwardness in my opinion.

So, I'm heavily involved in reading my updates on The Jersey Shore and Brangelina when I happen to glance down and she's painting a white flower on my toes.  What?  No.  No, no no.  I do not want a flower.  So I made her take it off and re-paint my big toes.  Who does that?  You ask before you put something so painfully feminine on my feet.  Seriously.

Now, this is where things take a turn for the worse.  I go to pay.  And let me tell you, I haven't paid more than $30 for a pedicure in this town...EVER.  So, they tell me it's going to be $45.  WHAT?  Was that OPI nailpolish made of gold?  Did I just blackout?  Whatever, I move on...nothing I can do now. I hand her my credit card.  She says ""no credit card, use ATM in the corner.""

We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. 

You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says ""Ok, that's $3."" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.

When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said ""Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there."" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said ""Oh"" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.

At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely ""We don't have any more."" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. 

Seriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. 

And as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back.",review,3,RyKKn7lV7StxDngkGt_6_w

The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.

Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just ""you ready to order?""

We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.

The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.

I would definitely consider myself a Postino expert. Postino was a go to for countless dates of mine. I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed. 

When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!

I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino.

Let me paint you a picture of what I seen and heard. I went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a Frys apron. He went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good. It appeared he was just asking for that day. The front end manger replied, ""I am not sure I don't know if you know how to do anything else. I just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before I consider anything else. I know I was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time. Let me tell you something Mr, Front end Manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and I am sure worked his tail off. Do NOT ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind  assistance where you can offer it. That is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or I am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go. So after listening to this and no it was not my business but I am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyone's business but we still slow down to see the wreck. So I proceeded to get my $325.00 of groceries at your place when I should have walked right out and drove down the road. I went isle to isle and as I neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear. Yes, I looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks (Are you serious what is wrong with you) type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees. However it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out. Because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile. Now let me gentle remind you FRYS without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day. I was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain -and not do something. So every week about 2 times I make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder. SHAME ON YOU! for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures. I wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means. But I figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse. Mark my words! If I ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as I pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by Home depot that I can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear.",review,1,3rnrg8aG6ODNJJ0h6Ls1MA

I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.

Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.

Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.

FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the ""10 minute"" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. 

That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.

I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.

***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).

  Very bad customer service..  This same Cashier 4 weeks ago overcharged me by $3. i asked for the correct change and he gave me $2 more back.  I was so pissed at this point i just left.

Last night my girlfriend brought me to Jt's, her boss said the wings were great. So I figured I'll try it.
When we get there, the lot is filled, I figured this is a good sign. But that where the optimism ended.
We had to sit near the back, the smell and temperature were almost unbearable, but I figured I wanted to try the food. My girlfriend ordered wings, she wanted ranch, I only eat wings with Blue Cheese, then I get a burger and onion rings... And a coke. 

After a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well. 
The waitress comes back a little later to let us know, there's no more onion rings.

After a long wait, we finally get the wings, as she sets them down, thats when she lets me know there's no more blue cheese. If I was by myself, I would have left at that point, I was also hungry. 

My burger came, it was one of those pre made paddies you get at cosco, I lifted the bun and the whole patty fell apart. The cheese was some sort of burned shredded cheese. 

I counted the 'fries' I received with he burger, I counted 12 small pathetic fries. 

These wings everyone talks about were burnt and dry, this confuses me the most. 
I mentioned to my girlfriend that I don't think her boss likes her, people must send patrons there when they dislike them. 

With all the places in the valley to get really good wings, good service and other good dishes, I put this mystery of why people rave about this place up there with the mystery of the pyramids... 

Ugh, I still cant get the image of that sorry burger out of my mind!",review,1,uwnVid11KIaUgFc8eY9oFQ

He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!
*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did.

I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.
I go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.
The dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.
I went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been ""had"".
I should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*

I was on hold forever when I was finally told that the factory had made an error with my prescription and that they had to be sent back.  I was told that they would rush the service and call me as soon as the glasses were ready.  I waited a week and called to see when the glasses would be ready and was told they just arrived.  I went in and picked them up.  I wore the glasses for two days when a friend informed me that the glasses were not darkening in the sun.

When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and would do a rush service on the glasses. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.

The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and I tried them on and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  We went in and she did some more adjustments to the glasses and cleaned them.

I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it ""to go"" as we were running out of time.

As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with ""Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first."" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour. Booooooo!!!",review,3,ZQXTsZ_XwCFMmawgnJeMhg

With one other person at the bar, you'd think the service would be reasonable. The only other time I saw the bartender was when my glass was empty. I ordered another thinking she'd offer me a menu at least...never happened!! So I paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat. Btw, my bill for 2 glasses of ""house"" wine during happy hour was more than $15!!! Other servers appeared to be much more customer-focused.",review,0,0zmdxts7rIevQjLgol8LbQ

But we have gone there a few times now and we have not had a good experience.  The food is ok, but the service and ambience leave a lot to be desired.  We like to sit at the bar to keep it simple, but the bartender couldn't wait for the night to end. A. request for water was ignored, as well as just ignoring us in general.  We looked around and the servers seemed to be staring at customers hoping they would just leave.  No one greeted us coming in, and true to form, no one thanked us on our way out.  We like to eat out and we prefer to stay close to home, but we will travel farther to go to a restaurant that wants our business.",review,0,cQqj4Co79WMiFkzxZkR7qw

I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea. 

Then the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages. 

Our horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements.",review,7,q9XgOylNsSbqZqF_SO3-OQ
